"Peer-to-peer ( P2P ) computing or networking is a distributed application architecture that partitions tasks or workloads between peers . Peers are equally privileged , equipotent participants in the application . They are said to form a peer-to-peer network of nodes ."
"Peers make a portion of their resources , such as processing power , disk storage or network bandwidth , directly available to other network participants , without the need for central coordination by servers or stable hosts . [ 1 ] Peers are both suppliers and consumers of resources , in contrast to the traditional client-server model in which the consumption and supply of resources is divided . Emerging collaborative P2P systems are going beyond the era of peers doing similar things while sharing resources , and are looking for diverse peers that can bring in unique resources and capabilities to a virtual community thereby empowering it to engage in greater tasks beyond those that can be accomplished by individual peers , yet that are beneficial to all the peers . [ 2 ]"
"While P2P systems had previously been used in many application domains , [ 3 ] the architecture was popularized by the file sharing system Napster , originally released in 1999 . The concept has inspired new structures and philosophies in many areas of human interaction . In such social contexts , peer-to-peer as a meme refers to the egalitarian social networking that has emerged throughout society , enabled by Internet technologies in general ."
"A peer-to-peer network is designed around the notion of equal peer nodes simultaneously functioning as both `` clients '' and `` servers '' to the other nodes on the network . This model of network arrangement differs from the client–server model where communication is usually to and from a central server . A typical example of a file transfer that uses the client-server model is the File Transfer Protocol ( FTP ) service in which the client and server programs are distinct : the clients initiate the transfer , and the servers satisfy these requests ."
"Peer-to-peer networks generally implement some form of virtual overlay network on top of the physical network topology , where the nodes in the overlay form a subset of the nodes in the physical network . Data is still exchanged directly over the underlying TCP/IP network , but at the application layer peers are able to communicate with each other directly , via the logical overlay links ( each of which corresponds to a path through the underlying physical network ) . Overlays are used for indexing and peer discovery , and make the P2P system independent from the physical network topology . Based on how the nodes are linked to each other within the overlay network , and how resources are indexed and located , we can classify networks as unstructured or structured ( or as a hybrid between the two ) ."
"Unstructured peer-to-peer networks do not impose a particular structure on the overlay network by design , but rather are formed by nodes that randomly form connections to each other . [ 11 ] ( Gnutella , Gossip , and Kazaa are examples of unstructured P2P protocols ) . [ 12 ]"
"Because there is no structure globally imposed upon them , unstructured networks are easy to build and allow for localized optimizations to different regions of the overlay . [ 13 ] Also , because the role of all peers in the network is the same , unstructured networks are highly robust in the face of high rates of `` churn '' —that is , when large numbers of peers are frequently joining and leaving the network . [ 14 ] [ 15 ]"
"However , the primary limitations of unstructured networks also arise from this lack of structure . In particular , when a peer wants to find a desired piece of data in the network , the search query must be flooded through the network to find as many peers as possible that share the data . Flooding causes a very high amount of signaling traffic in the network , uses more CPU/memory ( by requiring every peer to process all search queries ) , and does not ensure that search queries will always be resolved . Furthermore , since there is no correlation between a peer and the content managed by it , there is no guarantee that flooding will find a peer that has the desired data . Popular content is likely to be available at several peers and any peer searching for it is likely to find the same thing . But if a peer is looking for rare data shared by only a few other peers , then it is highly unlikely that search will be successful . [ 16 ]"
"In structured peer-to-peer networks the overlay is organized into a specific topology , and the protocol ensures that any node can efficiently [ 17 ] search the network for a file/resource , even if the resource is extremely rare ."
"The most common type of structured P2P networks implement a distributed hash table ( DHT ) , [ 18 ] [ 19 ] in which a variant of consistent hashing is used to assign ownership of each file to a particular peer . [ 20 ] [ 21 ] This enables peers to search for resources on the network using a hash table : that is , ( key , value ) pairs are stored in the DHT , and any participating node can efficiently retrieve the value associated with a given key ."
"However , in order to route traffic efficiently through the network , nodes in a structured overlay must maintain lists of neighbors [ 24 ] that satisfy specific criteria . This makes them less robust in networks with a high rate of churn ( i.e . with large numbers of nodes frequently joining and leaving the network ) . [ 15 ] [ 25 ] More recent evaluation of P2P resource discovery solutions under real workloads have pointed out several issues in DHT-based solutions such as high cost of advertising/discovering resources and static and dynamic load imbalance . [ 26 ]"
"Notable distributed networks that use DHTs include Tixati , an alternative to BitTorrent 's distributed tracker , the Kad network , the Storm botnet , YaCy , and the Coral Content Distribution Network . Some prominent research projects include the Chord project , Kademlia , PAST storage utility , P-Grid , a self-organized and emerging overlay network , and CoopNet content distribution system . [ 27 ] DHT-based networks have also been widely utilized for accomplishing efficient resource discovery [ 28 ] [ 29 ] for grid computing systems , as it aids in resource management and scheduling of applications ."
"Hybrid models are a combination of peer-to-peer and client-server models . [ 30 ] A common hybrid model is to have a central server that helps peers find each other . Spotify was an example of a hybrid model [ until 2014 ] . There are a variety of hybrid models , all of which make trade-offs between the centralized functionality provided by a structured server/client network and the node equality afforded by the pure peer-to-peer unstructured networks . Currently , hybrid models have better performance than either pure unstructured networks or pure structured networks because certain functions , such as searching , do require a centralized functionality but benefit from the decentralized aggregation of nodes provided by unstructured networks . [ 31 ]"
CoopNet content distribution system
"CoopNet ( Cooperative Networking ) was a proposed system for off-loading serving to peers who have recently downloaded content , proposed by computer scientists Venkata N. Padmanabhan and Kunwadee Sripanidkulchai , working at Microsoft Research and Carnegie Mellon University . [ 32 ] [ 33 ] Basically when a server experiences an increase in load it redirects incoming peers to other peers who have agreed to mirror the content , thus off-loading balance from the server . All of the information is retained at the server . This system makes use of the fact that the bottle-neck is most likely in the outgoing bandwidth than the CPU , hence its server-centric design . It assigns peers to other peers who are 'close in IP ' to its neighbors [ same prefix range ] in an attempt to use locality . If multiple peers are found with the same file it designates that the node choose the fastest of its neighbors . Streaming media is transmitted by having clients cache the previous stream , and then transmit it piece-wise to new nodes ."
Security and trust
Peer-to-peer systems pose unique challenges from a computer security perspective .
"Like any other form of software , P2P applications can contain vulnerabilities . What makes this particularly dangerous for P2P software , however , is that peer-to-peer applications act as servers as well as clients , meaning that they can be more vulnerable to remote exploits . [ 34 ]"
Routing attacks
"Also , since each node plays a role in routing traffic through the network , malicious users can perform a variety of `` routing attacks '' , or denial of service attacks . Examples of common routing attacks include `` incorrect lookup routing '' whereby malicious nodes deliberately forward requests incorrectly or return false results , `` incorrect routing updates '' where malicious nodes corrupt the routing tables of neighboring nodes by sending them false information , and `` incorrect routing network partition '' where when new nodes are joining they bootstrap via a malicious node , which places the new node in a partition of the network that is populated by other malicious nodes . [ 35 ]"
Corrupted data and malware

"The prevalence of malware varies between different peer-to-peer protocols . Studies analyzing the spread of malware on P2P networks found , for example , that 63 % of the answered download requests on the gnutella network contained some form of malware , whereas only 3 % of the content on OpenFT contained malware . In both cases , the top three most common types of malware accounted for the large majority of cases ( 99 % in gnutella , and 65 % in OpenFT ) . Another study analyzing traffic on the Kazaa network found that 15 % of the 500,000 file sample taken were infected by one or more of the 365 different computer viruses that were tested for . [ 36 ]"
"Corrupted data can also be distributed on P2P networks by modifying files that are already being shared on the network . For example , on the FastTrack network , the RIAA managed to introduce faked chunks into downloads and downloaded files ( mostly MP3 files ) . Files infected with the RIAA virus were unusable afterwards and contained malicious code . The RIAA is also known to have uploaded fake music and movies to P2P networks in order to deter illegal file sharing . [ 37 ] Consequently , the P2P networks of today have seen an enormous increase of their security and file verification mechanisms . Modern hashing , chunk verification and different encryption methods have made most networks resistant to almost any type of attack , even when major parts of the respective network have been replaced by faked or nonfunctional hosts . [ 38 ]"
Resilient and scalable computer networks

"The decentralized nature of P2P networks increases robustness because it removes the single point of failure that can be inherent in a client-server based system . [ 39 ] As nodes arrive and demand on the system increases , the total capacity of the system also increases , and the likelihood of failure decreases . If one peer on the network fails to function properly , the whole network is not compromised or damaged . In contrast , in a typical client–server architecture , clients share only their demands with the system , but not their resources . In this case , as more clients join the system , fewer resources are available to serve each client , and if the central server fails , the entire network is taken down ."
"There are both advantages and disadvantages in P2P networks related to the topic of data backup , recovery , and availability . In a centralized network , the system administrators are the only forces controlling the availability of files being shared . If the administrators decide to no longer distribute a file , they simply have to remove it from their servers , and it will no longer be available to users . Along with leaving the users powerless in deciding what is distributed throughout the community , this makes the entire system vulnerable to threats and requests from the government and other large forces . For example , YouTube has been pressured by the RIAA , MPAA , and entertainment industry to filter out copyrighted content . Although server-client networks are able to monitor and manage content availability , they can have more stability in the availability of the content they choose to host . A client should not have trouble accessing obscure content that is being shared on a stable centralized network . P2P networks , however , are more unreliable in sharing unpopular files because sharing files in a P2P network requires that at least one node in the network has the requested data , and that node must be able to connect to the node requesting the data . This requirement is occasionally hard to meet because users may delete or stop sharing data at any point . [ 40 ]"
"In this sense , the community of users in a P2P network is completely responsible for deciding what content is available . Unpopular files will eventually disappear and become unavailable as more people stop sharing them . Popular files , however , will be highly and easily distributed . Popular files on a P2P network actually have more stability and availability than files on central networks . In a centralized network , a simple loss of connection between the server and clients is enough to cause a failure , but in P2P networks , the connections between every node must be lost in order to cause a data sharing failure . In a centralized system , the administrators are responsible for all data recovery and backups , while in P2P systems , each node requires its own backup system . Because of the lack of central authority in P2P networks , forces such as the recording industry , RIAA , MPAA , and the government are unable to delete or stop the sharing of content on P2P systems ."
"In P2P networks , clients both provide and use resources . This means that unlike client-server systems , the content-serving capacity of peer-to-peer networks can actually increase as more users begin to access the content ( especially with protocols such as Bittorrent that require users to share , refer a performance measurement study [ 42 ] ) . This property is one of the major advantages of using P2P networks because it makes the setup and running costs very small for the original content distributor . [ 43 ] [ 44 ]"

Companies developing P2P applications have been involved in numerous legal cases , primarily in the United States , over conflicts with copyright law . [ 46 ] Two major cases are Grokster vs RIAA and MGM Studios , Inc. v. Grokster , Ltd.. [ 47 ] In the last case , the Court unanimously held that defendant peer-to-peer file sharing companies Grokster and Streamcast could be sued for inducing copyright infringement ."

"Researchers have used computer simulations to aid in understanding and evaluating the complex behaviors of individuals within the network . `` Networking research often relies on simulation in order to test and evaluate new ideas . An important requirement of this process is that results must be reproducible so that other researchers can replicate , validate , and extend existing work . `` [ 63 ] If the research can not be reproduced , then the opportunity for further research is hindered . `` Even though new simulators continue to be released , the research community tends towards only a handful of open-source simulators . The demand for features in simulators , as shown by our criteria and survey , is high . Therefore , the community should work together to get these features in open-source software . This would reduce the need for custom simulators , and hence increase repeatability and reputability of experiments . `` [ 63 ]"

"A client–queue–client or passive queue system is a client–server computer network in which the server is a data queue for the clients . Instead of communicating with each other directly , clients exchange data with one another by storing it in a repository ( the queue ) on a server . [ 1 ]"
"Like peer-to-peer , the client–queue–client system empowers hosts on the network to serve data to other hosts ."
"Web crawlers on different hosts need to query each other to synchronize an indexed URI . Whereas one approach is to program each crawler to receive and respond to such queries , the client–queue–client approach is to store the indexed content from both crawlers in a passive queue , such as a relational database , on another host . Both web crawlers read and write to the database , but never communicate with each other ."
"Semantic P2P networks are a new type of P2P network . It combines the advantages of unstructured P2P networks and structural P2P networks , and avoids their disadvantages ."
"In Semantic P2P networks , nodes are classified as DNS-like domain names with semantic meanings such as Alice @ Brittney.popular.music . Semantic P2P networks contains prerequisite virtual tree topology and net-like topology formed by cached nodes . Semantic P2P networks keep the semantic meanings of nodes and their contents . The nodes within semantic P2P networks can communicate each other by various languages . Semantic P2P network can execute complicated queries by SQL-like language ."
"There are similarities between semantic P2P systems and software agents . P2P means that entities exchange information directly without a mediator . Semantic is a concept to add meaning to information . Peer are usually autonomous systems as well as agents . Agents follow a goal , though . Such goal attainment requires a knowledge base and rules and strategies . That 's the major difference between software agents and semantic peers . The latter lacks that kind of intelligence ."
"Segmented file-transfer ( also known as multisource file-transfer or swarming file-transfer ) is a software method that is intended to improve file download speed . It works by simultaneously downloading different portions of the computer file sourced from either multiple servers or from a single server , recombining the parts into the single file requested . The majority of Download Manager applications work in this way ."
