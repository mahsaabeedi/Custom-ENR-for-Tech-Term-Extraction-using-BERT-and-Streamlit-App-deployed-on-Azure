"Backpressure routing is an algorithm for dynamically routing traffic over a multi-hop network by using congestion gradients . The algorithm can be applied to wireless communication networks , including sensor networks , mobile ad hoc networks ( MANETS ) , and heterogeneous networks with wireless and wireline components ."
"Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector ( AODV ) Routing is a routing protocol for mobile ad hoc networks ( MANETs ) and other wireless ad hoc networks . It was jointly developed on July 2003 in Nokia Research Center , University of California , Santa Barbara and University of Cincinnati by C. Perkins , E. Belding-Royer and S . Das . [ 1 ]"
"AODV is the routing protocol used in ZigBee – a low power , low data rate wireless ad hoc network . There are various implementations of AODV such as MAD-HOC , Kernel-AODV , AODV-UU , AODV-UCSB and AODV-UIUC ."
"Extremely Opportunistic Routing ( ExOR ) is a combination of routing protocol and media access control for a wireless ad hoc network , invented by Sanjit Biswas and Robert Morris of the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory , and described in a 2005 paper . [ 1 ] A very similar opportunistic routing scheme was also independently proposed by Zhenzhen Ye and Yingbo Hua from University of California , Riverside and presented in a paper in 2005 . [ 2 ] Previously open source , [ 3 ] ExOR was available in 2005 but is no longer obtainable . The broadcast and retransmission strategies used by the algorithm were already described in the literature . [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] ExOR is valuable because it can operate available digital radios to use some previously impractical algorithmic optimizations ."
"DSR , AODV and OLSR are leading conventional public-domain solutions to the same problem . DSDV was the original routing system used by RoofNet ."
Hazy Sighted Link State Routing Protocol ( HSLS ) provides a routing protocol that may complement the media access and transport layers provided by ExOR .
"Net metering ( or net energy metering , NEM ) is an electricity billing mechanism that allows consumers who generate some or all of their own electricity to use that electricity anytime , instead of when it is generated . This is particularly important with renewable energy sources like wind and solar , which are non-dispatchable ( when not coupled to storage ) . Monthly net metering allows consumers to use solar power generated during the day at night , or wind from a windy day later in the month . Annual net metering rolls over a net kilowatt-hour ( kWh ) credit to the following month , allowing solar power that was generated in July to be used in December , or wind power from March in August ."
"Sources that produce direct current , such as solar panels must be coupled with an electrical inverter to convert the output to alternating current , for use with conventional appliances . The phase of the outgoing power must be synchronized with the grid , and a mechanism must be included to disconnect the feed in the event of grid failure . This is for safety – for example , workers repairing downed power lines must be protected from `` downstream '' sources , in addition to being disconnected from the main `` upstream '' distribution grid . Note : A small generator simply lacks the power to energize a loaded line . This can only happen if the line is isolated from other loads , and is extremely unlikely . Solar inverters are designed for safety – while one inverter could not energize a line , a thousand might . In addition , all electrical workers should treat every line as though it was live , even when they know it should be safe ."
