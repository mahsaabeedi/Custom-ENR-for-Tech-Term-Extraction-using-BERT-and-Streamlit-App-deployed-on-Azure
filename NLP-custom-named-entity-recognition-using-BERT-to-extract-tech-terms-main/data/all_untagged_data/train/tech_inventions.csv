"A USB dead drop is a USB mass storage device installed in a public space . For example , a USB flash drive might be mounted in an outdoor brick wall and fixed in place with fast concrete . [ 1 ] Members of the public are implicitly invited to find files , or leave files , on a dead drop by directly plugging their laptop into the wall-mounted USB stick in order to transfer data . ( It is also possible to use smartphones and tablets for this purpose , by utilizing a USB on-the-go cable . ) The dead drops can therefore be regarded as an anonymous , offline , peer-to-peer file sharing network . However , in practice USB dead drops are often used for social or artistic reasons , rather than for practical ones ."
"Some of the advantages of utilizing USB dead drops are practical in nature : they permit P2P file sharing without needing any internet or cellular connection , sharing files with another person secretly/anonymously , and they record no IP address or similar personally identifying information . Other benefits are more social or artistic in nature : USB dead drops are an opportunity to practice `` datalove '' and can be seen as a way to promote off-grid data networks . The motive to utilize USB dead drops has been compared to what drives people involved in geocaching , which has been around for much longer and is somewhat similar in that often a set of GPS coordinates is used to locate a particular USB dead drop , [ 12 ] in particular that USB dead drops give the user `` the thrill of discovery '' [ 13 ] both in seeking out the location of the dead drop , and then also in addition when examining the data it contains ."

"In a new report , Min-Kyu Kim , and a team of scientists in materials science and engineering at the Pohang University of Science and Technology in Korea , demonstrated a unique strategy by applying hafnia-based ferroelectrics and oxide semiconductors for three-dimensional ( 3-D ) integration . The strategy achieved memory performance beyond the conventional flash memory and exceeded those achieved by perovskite ferroelectric memories . The team then simulated the devices to confirm the ability to realize ultra-high-density 3-D memory integration ."
"Scientists therefore developed a range of emerging memory devices to overcome these limits , however , there are no existing alternatives to current flash memory in order to obtain fast functionality at a low power . In the meantime , researchers have developed hafnia-based ferroelectric materials due to their complementary metal-oxide semiconductor ( CMOS ) compatibility , low power consumption and fast switching speed ."
Energy harvesting : Printed thermoelectric generators for power generation

Trapping gases better with boron nitride 'nanopores '
"Scientists globally aim to control chemical reactions—an ambitious goal that requires identifying the steps taken by initial reactants to arrive at the final products as the reaction takes place . While this dream remains to be realized , techniques for probing chemical reactions have become sufficiently advanced to render it possible . In fact , chemical reactions can now be monitored based on the change of electronic properties of a single molecule ! Thanks to the scanning tunneling microscope ( STM ) , this is also simple to accomplish ."
"The synthesis of the novel carbon catalysts is based on polymeric carbon precursors that can be produced by a reproducible and easily scalable synthetic pathway while providing excellent control of the morphology of the subsequent carbon . Using catalytic graphitization , it was demonstrated that during pyrolysis of the polymer precursor , nanoscale graphite crystallites could be grown within the carbon matrix . Fundamental in this context seems to be the presence of large conjugated ( graphitic ) domains characterized by a high density of defect sites , where oxygen surface groups , such as ketonic carbonyl groups , are created during the reaction . The activity of these surface groups seems to be increased through the neighboring conjugated ( graphitic ) domains , which can act as electron storage . Catalytic graphitization yields an amorphous/graphitic hybrid material consisting of the prior grown graphite crystallites surrounded by an amorphous carbon matrix . To obtain an active dehydrogenation catalyst , the amorphous carbon matrix is removed by selective oxidation , opening the pore structure of the carbon material and providing accessibility to the catalytically active graphite domains ."
"A solution to these problems may lie in a strain of cyanobacteria with surprising properties . Cyanobacteria of the genus Synechocystis produce polyhydroxybutyrate ( PHB ) , a natural form of plastic . PHB can be used in a similar way to the plastic polypropylene but is rapidly degradable in the environment , as well as pollutant-free . However , the amount produced by these bacteria is usually very small . The Tübingen research group succeeded in identifying a control system in the bacteria that limits the intracellular flow of fixed carbon towards PHB . After removing the corresponding regulator and implementing several further genetic changes , the amount of PHB produced by the bacteria increased enormously and eventually accounted for more than 80 percent of the cell 's total mass . `` We have created veritable plastic bacteria , '' says Dr. Moritz Koch , first author of the study published in Microbial Cell Factories ."
"In a recent study published in Angewandte Chemie International Edition , a team of scientists from Tokyo Tech , Yamagata University , and Sagami Chemical Research Institute , Japan , made remarkable progress with bulk self-strengthening polymers . Professor Hideyuki Otsuka , who led the study , explains their motivation : `` Furthering the development of elegant bulk systems in which a force-induced reaction causes a clear change in mechanical properties would represent a game-changing advance in mechanochemistry , polymer chemistry , and materials science . '' They achieved this goal by focusing on difluorenylsuccinonitrile ( DFSN ) , a 'mechanophore ' or molecule that responds to mechanical stress ."
"The team created segmented polyurethane polymeric chains with hard as well as soft functional segments . The soft segments contain DFSN molecules acting as their `` weakest link , '' with both of its halves joined by a single covalent bond . The soft segments also have their side chains topped off with methacryloyl units . Upon applying mechanical stress , such as simple compression or extension , on the polymer , the DFSN molecule splits into two equal cyanofluorene ( CF ) radicals . These CF radicals , unlike DFSN , acquire a pink color , making it easy to visually detect mechanical damage ."
"3-D skin mapping could be useful to clinicians , as most equipment used to assess skin conditions only provide 2-D images of the skin surface . As the device also maps out the depth of the ridges and grooves of the skin at up to 2mm , it could also help with monitoring wound healing . The device presses a specially devised film onto the subject 's skin to obtain an imprint of up to 5 by 5 centimeters , which is then subjected to an electric charge , generating a 3-D image ."

"Micro droplets , stabilized using a thin shell , can be visualized in the blood stream using ultrasound . They have a growing number of medical applications in imaging and therapy . The droplets , however , are too large to invade a tumor . Smaller nanoscale droplets can do this . By guiding them to the tumor and vaporizing them on the spot , the resulting bubbles can have a therapeutic effect inside the tumor . Vaporization may typically seem a physical phenomenon of which everything is known already , but the UT researchers now demonstrate a new mechanism based on resonance , as in the case of crystal glass breaks caused by the sound of a specific singing note . It is at the resonance frequency that vaporization can be guided and amplified . The research was done using droplets of hydrofluorocarbons ( HFCs ) , with a low boiling point ."
NUS scientists have demonstrated a general approach for characterizing the atomic structure and electronic and magnetic properties of two-dimensional ( 2-D ) magnetic insulators using scanning-tunneling microscopy .
"The recent discovery of 2-D magnets and the development of van der Waals ( vdW ) heterostructure engineering offer unprecedented opportunities not only to explore the exciting physics of magnetism in reduced dimensions , but also to develop new-generation spintronic devices for quantum technology applications . Further developments in this area involve the atomic-level understanding of electronic and magnetic properties of 2-D magnets and their heterostructures . Unfortunately , the direct application of conventional scanning tunneling microscopy ( STM ) techniques to learn more about the material properties does not work well for 2-D magnetic insulators . STM imaging relies on the quantum tunneling effect , whereby electrons tunnel from the atomically-sharp tip to the conducting samples or vice versa . It can not be applied to study insulating bulk materials as there is an absence of a conducting path ."

An artificial uterus ( or artificial womb ) is a device that would allow for extracorporeal pregnancy [ 2 ] by growing a fetus outside the body of an organism that would normally carry the fetus to term .
"An artificial uterus , as a replacement organ , would have many applications . It could be used to assist male or female couples in the development of a fetus . [ 2 ] This can potentially be performed as a switch from a natural uterus to an artificial uterus , thereby moving the threshold of fetal viability to a much earlier stage of pregnancy . [ 2 ] In this sense , it can be regarded as a neonatal incubator with very extended functions . It could also be used for the initiation of fetal development . [ 2 ] An artificial uterus could also help make fetal surgery procedures at an early stage an option instead of having to postpone them until term of pregnancy ."
