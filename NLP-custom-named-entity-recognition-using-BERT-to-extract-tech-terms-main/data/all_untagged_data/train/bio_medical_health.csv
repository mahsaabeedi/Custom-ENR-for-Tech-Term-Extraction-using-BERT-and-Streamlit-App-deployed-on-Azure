"Some examples include pacemakers , infusion pumps , the heart-lung machine , dialysis machines , artificial organs , implants , artificial limbs , corrective lenses , cochlear implants , ocular prosthetics , facial prosthetics , somato prosthetics , and dental implants ."
"Imaging technologies are often essential to medical diagnosis , and are typically the most complex equipment found in a hospital including : fluoroscopy , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , nuclear medicine , positron emission tomography ( PET ) , PET-CT scans , projection radiography such as X-rays and CT scans , tomography , ultrasound , optical microscopy , and electron microscopy ."
"Medical devices vary in both their intended use and indications for use . Examples range from simple , low-risk devices such as tongue depressors , medical thermometers , disposable gloves , and bedpans to complex , high-risk devices that are implanted and sustain life . One example of high-risk devices are those with embedded software such as pacemakers , and which assist in the conduct of medical testing , implants , and prostheses . The design of medical devices constitutes a major segment of the field of biomedical engineering ."
"Medical devices such as pacemakers , insulin pumps , operating room monitors , defibrillators , and surgical instruments , including deep-brain stimulators , can incorporate the ability to transmit vital health information from a patient 's body to medical professionals ."
"Diagnostic equipment includes medical imaging machines , used to aid in diagnosis . Examples are ultrasound and MRI machines , PET and CT scanners , and x-ray machines ."
"Treatment equipment includes infusion pumps , medical lasers and LASIK surgical machines ."
"Life support equipment is used to maintain a patient 's bodily function . This includes medical ventilators , incubators , anaesthetic machines , heart-lung machines , ECMO , and dialysis machines ."
"Medical monitors allow medical staff to measure a patient 's medical state . Monitors may measure patient vital signs and other parameters including ECG , EEG , and blood pressure ."
"Medical laboratory equipment automates or helps analyze blood , urine , genes , and dissolved gases in the blood ."
"Diagnostic medical equipment may also be used in the home for certain purposes , e.g . for the control of diabetes mellitus"
Therapeutic : physical therapy machines like continuous passive range of motion ( CPM ) machines
"Medical technology has evolved into smaller portable devices , for instance , smartphones , touchscreens , tablets , laptops , digital ink , voice and face recognition and more . With this technology , innovations like electronic health records ( EHR ) , health information exchange ( HIE ) , Nationwide Health Information Network ( NwHIN ) , personal health records ( PHRs ) , patient portals , nanomedicine , genome-based personalized medicine , Geographical Positioning System ( GPS ) , radio frequency identification ( RFID ) , telemedicine , clinical decision support ( CDS ) , mobile home health care and cloud computing came to exist . [ 26 ]"
"Medical imaging and Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) have been long used and proven Medical Technologies for medical research , patient reviewing , and treatment analyzing . With the advancement of imagining technologies , including the use of faster and more data , higher resolution images , and specialist automation software , the capabilities of medical imaging technology are growing and yielding better results . [ 27 ] As the imaging hardware and software evolve this means that patients will need to use less contrasting agents , and also spend less time and money . [ 28 ]"
"3D printing is another major development in healthcare . It can be used to produce specialized splints , prostheses , parts for medical devices and inert implants . The end goal of 3D printing is being able to print out customized replaceable body parts . [ 29 ] In the following section , it will explain more about 3D printing in healthcare . New types of technologies also include artificial intelligence and robots ."
"The implant has two main components . The outside component is generally worn behind the ear , but could also be attached to clothing , for example , in young children . This component , the sound processor , contains microphones , electronics that include digital signal processor ( DSP ) chips , battery , and a coil which transmits a signal to the implant across the skin . The inside component , the actual implant , has a coil to receive signals , electronics , and an array of electrodes which is placed into the cochlea , which stimulate the cochlear nerve ."
"A drug-eluting stent ( DES ) is a peripheral or coronary stent ( a scaffold ) placed into narrowed , diseased peripheral or coronary arteries that slowly releases a drug to block cell proliferation . [ 1 ] This prevents fibrosis that , together with clots ( thrombi ) , could otherwise block the stented artery , a process called restenosis . The stent is usually placed within the peripheral or coronary artery by an interventional cardiologist or interventional radiologist during an angioplasty procedure . [ 2 ]"
"Drug-eluting stents in current clinical use were approved by the FDA after clinical trials showed they were statistically superior to bare-metal stents for the treatment of native coronary artery narrowings , having lower rates of major adverse cardiac events ( usually defined as a composite clinical endpoint of death + myocardial infarction + repeat intervention because of restenosis ) . [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] The first drug-eluting stents to be approved in Europe and the U.S. were coated with paclitaxel or an mTOR inhibitor , such as sirolimus ."
