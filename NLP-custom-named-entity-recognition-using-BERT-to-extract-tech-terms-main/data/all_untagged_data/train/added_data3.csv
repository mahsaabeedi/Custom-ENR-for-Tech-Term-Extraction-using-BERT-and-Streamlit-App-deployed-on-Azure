"Dry Fog systems use a unique sonic atomising nozzle that creates water particles at less than 10 microns in size ( on average 4.91 micron ) – smaller than any other water , mist or ‘ fog ’ sprays on the market . By a process of agglomeration , these water particles bind with like-sized , and greater , dust particles to form larger and larger particles which settle out under gravity . This allows Dry Fog to tackle respirable dust , defined as dust with an aerodynamic diameter 10 microns ( PM10 ) and under in size , which is considered the most dangerous to health . PM10 dust is required to be monitored under Australian State and Territory Environmental Protection Authorities ."
