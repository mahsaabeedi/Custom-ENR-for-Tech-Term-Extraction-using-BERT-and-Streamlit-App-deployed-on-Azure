"A brain–computer interface ( BCI ) , sometimes called a neural control interface ( NCI ) , mind–machine interface ( MMI ) , direct neural interface ( DNI ) , or brain–machine interface ( BMI ) , is a direct communication pathway between an enhanced or wired brain and an external device . BCIs are often directed at researching , mapping , assisting , augmenting , or repairing human cognitive or sensory-motor functions . [ 1 ]"
"Research on BCIs began in the 1970s at the University of California , Los Angeles ( UCLA ) under a grant from the National Science Foundation , followed by a contract from DARPA . [ 2 ] [ 3 ] The papers published after this research also mark the first appearance of the expression brain–computer interface in scientific literature ."
"Due to the cortical plasticity of the brain , signals from implanted prostheses can , after adaptation , be handled by the brain like natural sensor or effector channels . [ 4 ] Following years of animal experimentation , the first neuroprosthetic devices implanted in humans appeared in the mid-1990s ."
"Recently , studies in human-computer interaction through the application of machine learning with statistical temporal features extracted from the frontal lobe , EEG brainwave data has shown high levels of success in classifying mental states ( Relaxed , Neutral , Concentrating ) , [ 5 ] mental emotional states ( Negative , Neutral , Positive ) [ 6 ] and thalamocortical dysrhythmia ."
"Neuroimaging or brain imaging is the use of various techniques to either directly or indirectly image the structure , function , or pharmacology of the nervous system . It is a relatively new discipline within medicine , neuroscience , and psychology . [ 1 ] Physicians who specialize in the performance and interpretation of neuroimaging in the clinical setting are neuroradiologists ."
"Functional near-infrared spectroscopy ( fNIRS ) , or Optical Topography as it is called in Japan exclusively , is the use of near-infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) for functional neuroimaging . Using fNIRS , cerebral hemodynamic responses are measured by near-infrared light , which go in line with cerebral activation or deactivation . In particular , this technology is capable of visualizing changes both in oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin concentration ."

"Diffuse optical imaging ( DOI ) is a method of imaging using near-infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) [ 1 ] or fluorescence-based methods . [ 2 ] When used to create 3D volumetric models of the imaged material DOI is referred to as diffuse optical tomography , whereas 2D imaging methods are classified as diffuse optical topography ."
"The technique has many applications to neuroscience , sports medicine , wound monitoring , and cancer detection . Typically DOI techniques monitor changes in concentrations of oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin and may additionally measure redox states of cytochromes . The technique may also be referred to as diffuse optical tomography ( DOT ) , [ 3 ] near infrared optical tomography ( NIROT ) or fluorescence diffuse optical tomography ( FDOT ) , depending on the usage ."
"In neuroscience , functional measurements made using NIR wavelengths , DOI techniques may classify as functional near infrared spectroscopy fNIRS ."
"Brain-reading or thought identification uses the responses of multiple voxels in the brain evoked by stimulus then detected by fMRI in order to decode the original stimulus . Advances in research have made this possible by using human neuroimaging to decode a person 's conscious experience based on non-invasive measurements of an individual 's brain activity . [ 1 ] Brain reading studies differ in the type of decoding ( i.e . classification , identification and reconstruction ) employed , the target ( i.e . decoding visual patterns , auditory patterns , cognitive states ) , and the decoding algorithms ( linear classification , nonlinear classification , direct reconstruction , Bayesian reconstruction , etc . ) employed ."
"Professor of neuropsychology Barbara Sahakian qualifies , `` A lot of neuroscientists in the field are very cautious and say we ca n't talk about reading individuals ' minds , and right now that is very true , but we 're moving ahead so rapidly , it 's not going to be that long before we will be able to tell whether someone 's making up a story , or whether someone intended to do a crime with a certain degree of certainty . ''"
"EEG has also been used to identify recognition of specific information or memories by the P300 event related potential , which has been dubbed 'brain fingerprinting ' ."
Neuroinformatics is a scientific study of information processing by nervous systems from a computational perspective .
"Neuroinformatics is related with philosophy ( computational theory of mind ) , psychology ( information processing theory ) , computer science ( natural computing , bio-inspired computing ) , among others . Neuroinformatics does n't deal with matter or energy , [ 1 ] so it can be seen as branch of neurobiology that study various aspects of nervous systems . The term neuroinformatics seems to be used synonymously with cognitive informatics , described by Journal of Biomedical Informatics as interdisciplinary domain that focuses on human information processing , mechanisms and processes within the context of computing and computing applications . [ 2 ] According to German National Library , neuroinformatics is synonymous with neurocomputing . [ 3 ] At Proceedings of the 10th IEEE International Conference on Cognitive Informatics and Cognitive Computing was intruduced the following description : Cognitive Informatics ( CI ) as a transdisciplinary enquiry of computer science , information sciences , cognitive science , and intelligence science . CI investigates into the internal information processing mechanisms and processes of the brain and natural intelligence , as well as their engineering applications in cognitive computing ."
"Electroencephalography ( EEG ) is an electrophysiological monitoring method to record electrical activity of the brain . It is typically noninvasive , with the electrodes placed along the scalp , although invasive electrodes are sometimes used , as in electrocorticography , sometimes called intracranial EEG ."
"EEG is most often used to diagnose epilepsy , which causes abnormalities in EEG readings . [ 2 ] It is also used to diagnose sleep disorders , depth of anesthesia , coma , encephalopathies , and brain death . EEG used to be a first-line method of diagnosis for tumors , stroke and other focal brain disorders , [ 3 ] [ 4 ] but this use has decreased with the advent of high-resolution anatomical imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) and computed tomography ( CT ) . Despite limited spatial resolution , EEG continues to be a valuable tool for research and diagnosis . It is one of the few mobile techniques available and offers millisecond-range temporal resolution which is not possible with CT , PET or MRI ."
"A head transplant is an experimental surgical operation involving the grafting of one organism 's head onto the body of another ; in many experiments the recipient 's head was not removed but in others it has been . Experimentation in animals began in the early 1900s . As of 2021 , no lasting successes have been achieved ."
"Neuralink has developed an Application-Specific Integrated Circuit ( ASIC ) to create a 1,536-channel recording system ."
"An application-specific integrated circuit ( ASIC / ' e ? s ? k/ ) is an integrated circuit ( IC ) chip customized for a particular use , rather than intended for general-purpose use . For example , a chip designed to run in a digital voice recorder or a high-efficiency bitcoin miner is an ASIC . Application-specific standard product ( ASSP ) chips are intermediate between ASICs and industry standard integrated circuits like the 7400 series or the 4000 series . [ 1 ] ASIC chips are typically fabricated using metal-oxide-semiconductor ( MOS ) technology , as MOS integrated circuit chips ."
"Field-programmable gate arrays ( FPGA ) are the modern-day technology for building a breadboard or prototype from standard parts ; programmable logic blocks and programmable interconnects allow the same FPGA to be used in many different applications . For smaller designs or lower production volumes , FPGAs may be more cost-effective than an ASIC design , even in production . The non-recurring engineering ( NRE ) cost of an ASIC can run into the millions of dollars . Therefore , device manufacturers typically prefer FPGAs for prototyping and devices with low production volume and ASICs for very large production volumes where NRE costs can be amortized across many devices ."
"Stentrode ( Stent-electrode recording array ) is a small stent-mounted electrode array that is permanently implanted into a blood vessel in the brain without the need for open brain surgery . It is in clinical trials [ 1 ] as a brain–computer interface ( BCI ) for people with paralyzed or missing limbs , who will use their neural signals or thoughts to control external devices , which currently include computer operating systems . The device may ultimately be used to control powered exoskeletons , robotic prosthesis , computers or other devices ."
