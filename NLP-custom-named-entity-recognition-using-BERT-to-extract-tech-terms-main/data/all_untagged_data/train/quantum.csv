"Quantum computing is the use of quantum phenomena such as superposition and entanglement to perform computation . Computers that perform quantum computations are known as quantum computers . [ 1 ] : I-5 Quantum computers are believed to be able to solve certain computational problems , such as integer factorization ( which underlies RSA encryption ) , substantially faster than classical computers . The study of quantum computing is a subfield of quantum information science ."
"Quantum technology is an emerging field of physics and engineering , which relies on the principles of quantum physics . [ 1 ] Quantum computing , quantum sensors , quantum cryptography , quantum simulation , quantum metrology and quantum imaging are all examples of quantum technologies , where properties of quantum mechanics , especially quantum entanglement , quantum superposition and quantum tunnelling , are important ."
"Quantum superposition states can be very sensitive to a number of external effects , such as electric , magnetic and gravitational fields ; rotation , acceleration and time , and therefore can be used to make very accurate sensors . There are many experimental demonstrations of quantum sensing devices , such as the experiments carried out by the Nobel laureate William D. Phillips on using cold atom interferometer systems to measure gravity and the atomic clock which is used by many national standards agencies around the world to define the second ."
"Efforts are being made to engineer quantum sensing devices that are cheaper , easier to use , more portable , lighter and consume less power . If successful , this is expected to lead to multiple commercial applications , such as monitoring of oil and gas deposits , or in construction ."
"Quantum secure communication are methods which are expected to be 'quantum safe ' in the advent of a quantum computing systems that could break current cryptography systems . One significant component of a quantum secure communication systems is expected to be Quantum key distribution , or 'QKD ' : a method of transmitting information using entangled light in a way that makes any interception of the transmission obvious to the user . Another technology in this field is the quantum random number generator used to protect data . This produces truly random number without following the procedure of the computing algorithms that merely imitate randomness ."
"Quantum computers are the ultimate quantum network , and are devices that can store and process quantum data ( as opposed to binary data ) with links that can transfer quantum information between 'quantum bits ' or 'qubits ' . If successfully developed , quantum computers are predicted to be able to perform certain algorithms significantly faster than even the largest classical computer available today ."
"Quantum computers are expected to have a number of important uses in computing fields such as optimization and machine learning . They are perhaps best known for their expected ability to carry out 'Shor 's Algorithm ' , which can be used to factorise large numbers , an important process in the securing of data transmissions ."
"The US National Institute of Standards and Technology has already said that quantum computers will be able to crack the existing public-key infrastructure like 128-bit AES encryption by 2029 . That prospect means businesses and governments are scrambling to improve the security of conventional networks , for example by using quantum-key cryptography . That ’ s a new market for quantum technology that ’ s expected to be worth anything from $ 214m to $ 1.3bn by 2024"
"With all that in mind , I ’ m delighted that here in the UK , construction of the new National Quantum Computing Centre ( NQCC ) will start this year . Thanks entirely to a £93m investment from UK Research and Innovation ( UKRI ) , the centre is being built at the Harwell lab of the Science and Technology Facilities Council in Oxfordshire . When it opens in late 2022 , the NQCC will bring together academia , business and government with the aim of delivering 100+ qubit user platforms by 2025 , thereby allowing UK firms to tap fully into this technology ’ s potential ."
"The NQCC is part of a £1bn , 10-year investment by the UK ’ s National Quantum Technologies Programme , which was launched by the UK government in 2013 . It has already created a national network of quantum technology hubs in quantum sensors and metrology ( Birmingham ) , quantum communications ( York ) , quantum enhanced imaging ( Glasgow ) , and quantum IT ( Oxford ) . Seeking to develop and commercialize new technology , the hubs are part of a growing quantum industry in the UK that saw more than 30 quantum start-ups founded by the end of 2019 ."
"The visionaries behind the programme were none other than Peter Knight – a former president of the Institute of Physics ( IOP ) – and David Delpy ( the IOP ’ s current honorary treasurer ) . The potential benefits of quantum technology to the UK economy were discussed at an online seminar run by the IOP ’ s Business Innovation and Growth group , which featured the IOP ’ s current president elect , Sheila Rowan , as well as Knight and the UKRI ’ s “ challenge director ” , Roger McKinley ."
"Last year , researchers at Google claimed that their Sycamore processor , which has 53 superconducting qubits , was able to verify in just 200 seconds that a set of numbers was randomly distributed . The same calculation , the firm said , would take 10,000 years on IBM ’ s Summit machine , which was the world ’ s most powerful supercomputer at the time . IBM hit back , insisting that , with some clever classical programming , its machine can solve the problem in 2.5 days . Either way , Google had reached a significant milestone towards realizing the immense promise of quantum computers – “ a wonderful achievement ” as Knight put it . “ It shows that quantum computing is really hard but not impossible , ” he added ."
"However , to do something really useful with quantum computers will require significantly more than 50 qubits . And given that a single qubit will set you back $ 10,000 or more , quantum computers will become commercially viable only when the cost per qubit has dropped dramatically . What ’ s more , we ’ ll have to get round the fact that current qubit devices are super-sensitive to external disturbances , so they have to be enclosed in sealed , cryogenically cooled boxes to maintain their quantum behaviour ."
"It ’ s worth recalling that when ENIAC – the first general purpose digital computer – was released in 1945 , it could do in 30 seconds what a human could do in 20 hours . But with its vacuum tubes and vast size , ENIAC was as far removed from today ’ s super-advanced classical devices as today ’ s quantum computers will be from those in 50 years ’ time . That ’ s why the race is on to scale and deliver a practical quantum computer , with many competing platforms , technologies and companies in the running ."
"Superconducting qubits might ultimately be replaced by something cheaper , more practical and scalable . Proper quantum computers will also require operating systems , programming languages , algorithms , input and output hardware , as well as the all-important storage and memory . That ’ s why I was particularly pleased to see ORCA – a UK firm – win one of the IOP ’ s business awards this year for developing a promising new approach to quantum computing memory , which allows single and entangled photons to be stored and synchronized ."
"Another key commercial milestone took place in September , when UK firm Cambridge Quantum Computing ( CQC ) launched the world ’ s first cloud-based Quantum Random Number Generation ( QRNG ) service using an IBM quantum computer . CQC offers true maximal randomness or entropy , which is impossible with a classical device and vital for accurate modelling and security applications ."
"It ’ s taken us 75 years to get from ENIAC to today ’ s integrated microprocessors , data centres , cloud-computing derived from “ quantum 1.0 ” devices ( semiconductor junctions , lasers and so on ) . Imagine a world with advanced “ quantum 2.0 ” devices and computers 75 years from now . It ’ s great to see such a co-ordinated and visionary programme here in the UK right now ."
"The best-known and developed application of quantum cryptography is quantum key distribution ( QKD ) , which is the process of using quantum communication to establish a shared key between two parties ( Alice and Bob , for example ) without a third party ( Eve ) learning anything about that key , even if Eve can eavesdrop on all communication between Alice and Bob . If Eve tries to learn information about the key being established , discrepancies will arise causing Alice and Bob to notice . Once the key is established , it is then typically used for encrypted communication using classical techniques . For instance , the exchanged key could be used for symmetric cryptography ."
"While QKD is seemingly secure , its applications face the challenge of practicality . This is due to transmission distance and key generation rate limitations . Ongoing studies and growing technology has allowed further advancements in such limitations . In 2018 Lucamarini et al . proposed a twin-field QKD scheme [ 16 ] that can possibly overcome the point-to-point repeater-less bounds of a lossy communication channel . [ 17 ] [ 18 ] The rate of the twin field protocol was shown to overcome the repeater-less PLOB bound [ 18 ] at 340 km of optical fiber ; its ideal rate surpasses this bound already at 200 km and follows the rate-loss scaling of the higher single-repeater bound ( see figure 1 of [ 16 ] for more details ) . The protocol suggests that optimal key rates are achievable on `` 550 kilometers of standard optical fibre '' , which is already commonly used in communications today . The theoretical result was confirmed in the first experimental demonstration of QKD beyond the rate-loss limit by Minder et al . in 2019 , [ 19 ] which has been characterised as the first effective quantum repeater ."
"Unlike quantum key distribution , quantum coin flipping is a protocol that is used between two participants who do not trust each other . [ 26 ] The participants communicate via a quantum channel and exchange information through the transmission of qubits . [ 27 ] But because Alice and Bob do not trust each other , each expects the other to cheat . Therefore , more effort must be spent on ensuring that neither Alice nor Bob can gain a significant advantage over the other to produce a desired outcome . An ability to influence a particular outcome is referred to as a bias , and there is a significant focus on developing protocols to reduce the bias of a dishonest player , [ 28 ] [ 29 ] otherwise known as cheating . Quantum communication protocols , including quantum coin flipping , have been shown to provide significant security advantages over classical communication , though they are difficult to realize in the practical world ."
"In addition to quantum coin-flipping , quantum commitment protocols are implemented when distrustful parties are involved . A commitment scheme allows a party Alice to fix a certain value ( to `` commit '' ) in such a way that Alice can not change that value while at the same time ensuring that the recipient Bob can not learn anything about that value until Alice reveals it . Such commitment schemes are commonly used in cryptographic protocols ( e.g . Quantum coin flipping , Zero-knowledge proof , secure two-party computation , and Oblivious transfer ) ."
"In the quantum setting , they would be particularly useful : Crépeau and Kilian showed that from a commitment and a quantum channel , one can construct an unconditionally secure protocol for performing so-called oblivious transfer . [ 32 ] Oblivious transfer , on the other hand , had been shown by Kilian to allow implementation of almost any distributed computation in a secure way ( so-called secure multi-party computation ) . [ 33 ] ( Notice that here we are a bit imprecise : The results by Crépeau and Kilian [ 32 ] [ 33 ] together do not directly imply that given a commitment and a quantum channel one can perform secure multi-party computation . This is because the results do not guarantee `` composability '' , that is , when plugging them together , one might lose security ."
"An extension of the BQSM is the noisy-storage model introduced by Wehner , Schaffner and Terhal . [ 39 ] Instead of considering an upper bound on the physical size of the adversary 's quantum memory , an adversary is allowed to use imperfect quantum storage devices of arbitrary size . The level of imperfection is modelled by noisy quantum channels . For high enough noise levels , the same primitives as in the BQSM can be achieved [ 40 ] and the BQSM forms a special case of the noisy-storage model ."
"Under the name of 'quantum tagging ' , the first position-based quantum schemes have been investigated in 2002 by Kent . A US-patent [ 44 ] was granted in 2006 . The notion of using quantum effects for location verification first appeared in the scientific literature in 2010 . [ 45 ] [ 46 ] After several other quantum protocols for position verification have been suggested in 2010 , [ 47 ] [ 48 ] Buhrman et al . claimed a general impossibility result : [ 49 ] using an enormous amount of quantum entanglement ( they use a doubly exponential number of EPR pairs , in the number of qubits the honest player operates on ) , colluding adversaries are always able to make it look to the verifiers as if they were at the claimed position . However , this result does not exclude the possibility of practical schemes in the bounded- or noisy-quantum-storage model ( see above ) . Later Beigi and König improved the amount of EPR pairs needed in the general attack against position-verification protocols to exponential . They also showed that a particular protocol remains secure against adversaries who controls only a linear amount of EPR pairs . [ 50 ] It is argued in [ 51 ] that due to time-energy coupling the possibility of formal unconditional location verification via quantum effects remains an open problem . It is worth mentioning that the study of position-based quantum cryptography has also connections with the protocol of port-based quantum teleportation , which is a more advanced version of quantum teleportation , where many EPR pairs are simultaneously used as ports ."
"A quantum cryptographic protocol is device-independent if its security does not rely on trusting that the quantum devices used are truthful . Thus the security analysis of such a protocol needs to consider scenarios of imperfect or even malicious devices . Mayers and Yao [ 52 ] proposed the idea of designing quantum protocols using `` self-testing '' quantum apparatus , the internal operations of which can be uniquely determined by their input-output statistics . Subsequently , Roger Colbeck in his Thesis [ 53 ] proposed the use of Bell tests for checking the honesty of the devices . Since then , several problems have been shown to admit unconditional secure and device-independent protocols , even when the actual devices performing the Bell test are substantially `` noisy , '' i.e. , far from being ideal . These problems include quantum key distribution , [ 54 ] [ 55 ] randomness expansion , [ 55 ] [ 56 ] and randomness amplification ."
"Quantum computers may become a technological reality ; it is therefore important to study cryptographic schemes used against adversaries with access to a quantum computer . The study of such schemes is often referred to as post-quantum cryptography . The need for post-quantum cryptography arises from the fact that many popular encryption and signature schemes ( schemes based on ECC and RSA ) can be broken using Shor 's algorithm for factoring and computing discrete logarithms on a quantum computer . Examples for schemes that are , as of today 's knowledge , secure against quantum adversaries are McEliece and lattice-based schemes , as well as most symmetric-key algorithms . [ 59 ] [ 60 ] Surveys of post-quantum cryptography are available ."
"So far , quantum cryptography has been mainly identified with the development of quantum key distribution protocols . Unfortunately , symmetric cryptosystems with keys that have been distributed by means of quantum key distribution become inefficient for large networks ( many users ) , because of the necessity for the establishment and the manipulation of many pairwise secret keys ( the so-called `` key-management problem '' ) . Moreover , this distribution alone does not address many other cryptographic tasks and functions , which are of vital importance in everyday life . Kak 's three-stage protocol has been proposed as a method for secure communication that is entirely quantum unlike quantum key distribution , in which the cryptographic transformation uses classical algorithms [ 66 ]"
"Besides quantum commitment and oblivious transfer ( discussed above ) , research on quantum cryptography beyond key distribution revolves around quantum message authentication , [ 67 ] quantum digital signatures , [ 68 ] [ 69 ] quantum one-way functions and public-key encryption , [ 70 ] [ 71 ] [ 72 ] [ 73 ] [ 74 ] [ 75 ] [ 76 ] quantum fingerprinting [ 77 ] and entity authentication [ 78 ] [ 79 ] [ 80 ] ( for example , see Quantum readout of PUFs ) , etc ."
"An optical fiber ( or fibre in British English ) is a flexible , transparent fiber made by drawing glass ( silica ) or plastic to a diameter slightly thicker than that of a human hair . [ 1 ] Optical fibers are used most often as a means to transmit light [ a ] between the two ends of the fiber and find wide usage in fiber-optic communications , where they permit transmission over longer distances and at higher bandwidths ( data transfer rates ) than electrical cables . Fibers are used instead of metal wires because signals travel along them with less loss ; in addition , fibers are immune to electromagnetic interference , a problem from which metal wires suffer . [ 2 ] Fibers are also used for illumination and imaging , and are often wrapped in bundles so they may be used to carry light into , or images out of confined spaces , as in the case of a fiberscope . [ 3 ] Specially designed fibers are also used for a variety of other applications , some of them being fiber optic sensors and fiber lasers ."
"Quantum cryptography is the science of exploiting quantum mechanical properties to perform cryptographic tasks . The best known example of quantum cryptography is quantum key distribution which offers an information-theoretically secure solution to the key exchange problem . The advantage of quantum cryptography lies in the fact that it allows the completion of various cryptographic tasks that are proven or conjectured to be impossible using only classical ( i.e . non-quantum ) communication . For example , it is impossible to copy data encoded in a quantum state . If one attempts to read the encoded data , the quantum state will be changed ( no-cloning theorem ) . This could be used to detect eavesdropping in quantum key distribution ."
"Quantum coin flipping uses the principles of quantum mechanics to encrypt messages for secure communication . Unlike other types of quantum cryptography , quantum coin flipping is a protocol used between two users who do not trust each other . [ 1 ] Because of this , both users ( or players ) want to win the coin toss and will attempt to cheat in various ways ."
"In cryptography , a zero-knowledge proof or zero-knowledge protocol is a method by which one party ( the prover ) can prove to another party ( the verifier ) that they know a value x , without conveying any information apart from the fact that they know the value x . The essence of zero-knowledge proofs is that it is trivial to prove that one possesses knowledge of certain information by simply revealing it ; the challenge is to prove such possession without revealing the information itself or any additional information ."
"Secure two-party computation ( 2PC ) is sub-problem of secure multi-party computation ( MPC ) that has received special attention by researchers because of its close relation to many cryptographic tasks . The goal of 2PC is to create a generic protocol that allows two parties to jointly compute an arbitrary function on their inputs without sharing the value of their inputs with the opposing party . One of the most well known examples of 2PC is Yao 's millionaire problem , in which two parties , Alice and Bob , are millionaires who wish to determine who is wealthier without revealing their wealth . Formally , Alice has wealth { \displaystyle a } a , Bob has wealth { \displaystyle b } b , and they wish to compute { \displaystyle a\geq b } a\geq b without revealing the values { \displaystyle a } a or { \displaystyle b } b ."
"Yao 's garbled circuit protocol for two-party computation [ 1 ] only provided security against passive adversaries . 2PC protocols that are secure against active adversaries were proposed by Lindell and Pinkas , [ 2 ] Ishai , Prabhakaran and Sahai [ 3 ] and Nielsen and Orlandi . [ 4 ] Another solution for this problem , that explicitly works with committed input was proposed by Jarecki and Shmatikov ."
"In cryptography , an oblivious transfer ( OT ) protocol is a type of protocol in which a sender transfers one of potentially many pieces of information to a receiver , but remains oblivious as to what piece ( if any ) has been transferred ."
"Quantum entanglement is a physical phenomenon that occurs when a pair or group of particles is generated , interact , or share spatial proximity in a way such that the quantum state of each particle of the pair or group can not be described independently of the state of the others , including when the particles are separated by a large distance . The topic of quantum entanglement is at the heart of the disparity between classical and quantum physics : entanglement is a primary feature of quantum mechanics lacking in classical mechanics ."
"The Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen paradox ( EPR paradox ) is a thought experiment proposed by physicists Albert Einstein , Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen ( EPR ) , with which they argued that the description of physical reality provided by quantum mechanics was incomplete . [ 1 ] In a 1935 paper titled `` Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality be Considered Complete ? `` , they argued for the existence of `` elements of reality '' that were not part of quantum theory , and speculated that it should be possible to construct a theory containing them . Resolutions of the paradox have important implications for the interpretation of quantum mechanics ."
A quantum cryptographic protocol is device-independent if its security does not rely on trusting that the quantum devices used are truthful . Thus the security analysis of such a protocol needs to consider scenarios of imperfect or even malicious devices . Several important problems have been shown to admit unconditional secure and device-independent protocols . A closely related topic ( that is not discussed in this article ) is measurement-device independent quantum key distribution .
"The goal of quantum key distribution is for two parties , Alice and Bob , to share a common secret string through communications over public channels . This was a problem of central interest in quantum cryptography . It was also the motivating problem in Mayers and Yao 's paper . [ 1 ] A long sequence of works aim to prove unconditional security with robustness . [ citation needed ] Vazirani and Vidick [ 3 ] were the first to reach this goal . Subsequently , Miller and Shi [ 4 ] proved a similar result using a different approach ."
"The goal of randomness expansion is to generate a longer private random string starting from a uniform input string and using untrusted quantum devices . The idea of using Bell test to achieve this goal was first proposed by Roger Colbeck in his Ph.D . Thesis . [ 2 ] Subsequent works have aimed to prove unconditional security with robustness and the increase the rate of expansion . [ citation needed ] Vazrani and Vidick were the first to prove full quantum security for an exponentially expanding protocol . [ 7 ] Miller and Shi [ 4 ] achieved several additional features , including cryptographic level security , robustness , and a single-qubit requirement on the quantum memory . The approach was subsequently extended by the same authors to show that the noise level can approach the obvious upper bound , when the output may become deterministic ."
"The goal of randomness amplification is to generate near-perfect randomness ( approximating a fair coin toss ) starting from a single source of weak randomness ( a coin each of whose tosses is somewhat unpredictable , though it may be biased and correlated with previous tosses ) . This is known to be impossible classically . [ 8 ] However , by using quantum devices , it becomes possible even if the devices are untrusted . Roger Colbeck and Renato Renner were motivated by physics considerations to ask the question first . [ 9 ] Their construction and the subsequent improvement by Gallego et al . [ 10 ] are secure against a non-signalling adversary , and have significant physical interpretations . The first construction that does not require any structural assumptions on the weak source is due to Chung , Shi , and Wu ."
"Post-quantum cryptography ( sometimes referred to as quantum-proof , quantum-safe or quantum-resistant ) refers to cryptographic algorithms ( usually public-key algorithms ) that are thought to be secure against an attack by a quantum computer . As of 2020 , this is not true for the most popular public-key algorithms , which can be efficiently broken by a sufficiently strong quantum computer . The problem with currently popular algorithms is that their security relies on one of three hard mathematical problems : the integer factorization problem , the discrete logarithm problem or the elliptic-curve discrete logarithm problem . All of these problems can be easily solved on a sufficiently powerful quantum computer running Shor 's algorithm . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] Even though current , publicly known , experimental quantum computers lack processing power to break any real cryptographic algorithm , [ 3 ] many cryptographers are designing new algorithms to prepare for a time when quantum computing becomes a threat . This work has gained greater attention from academics and industry through the PQCrypto conference series since 2006 and more recently by several workshops on Quantum Safe Cryptography hosted by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute ( ETSI ) and the Institute for Quantum Computing . [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ]"
"In contrast to the threat quantum computing poses to current public-key algorithms , most current symmetric cryptographic algorithms and hash functions are considered to be relatively secure against attacks by quantum computers . [ 2 ] [ 7 ] While the quantum Grover 's algorithm does speed up attacks against symmetric ciphers , doubling the key size can effectively block these attacks . [ 8 ] Thus post-quantum symmetric cryptography does not need to differ significantly from current symmetric cryptography . See section on symmetric-key approach below ."
"In physics , a quantum amplifier is an amplifier that uses quantum mechanical methods to amplify a signal ; examples include the active elements of lasers and optical amplifiers ."
"The main properties of the quantum amplifier are its amplification coefficient and uncertainty . These parameters are not independent ; the higher the amplification coefficient , the higher the uncertainty ( noise ) . In the case of lasers , the uncertainty corresponds to the amplified spontaneous emission of the active medium . The unavoidable noise of quantum amplifiers is one of the reasons for the use of digital signals in optical communications and can be deduced from the fundamentals of quantum mechanics ."
"Matrix isolation is an experimental technique used in chemistry and physics . It generally involves a material being trapped within an unreactive matrix . A host matrix is a continuous solid phase in which guest particles ( atoms , molecules , ions , etc . ) are embedded . The guest is said to be isolated within the host matrix . Initially the term matrix-isolation was used to describe the placing of a chemical species in any unreactive material , often polymers or resins , but more recently has referred specifically to gases in low-temperature solids . A typical matrix isolation experiment involves a guest sample being diluted in the gas phase with the host material , usually a noble gas or nitrogen . This mixture is then deposited on a window that is cooled to below the melting point of the host gas . The sample may then be studied using various spectroscopic procedures ."
"In quantum computing , a charge qubit ( also known as Cooper-pair box ) is a qubit whose basis states are charge states ( e.g . states which represent the presence or absence of excess Cooper pairs in the island ) . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] In superconducting quantum computing , a charge qubit [ 4 ] is formed by a tiny superconducting island coupled by a Josephson junction ( or practically , superconducting tunnel junction ) to a superconducting reservoir ( see figure ) . The state of the qubit is determined by the number of Cooper pairs which have tunneled across the junction . In contrast with the charge state of an atomic or molecular ion , the charge states of such an `` island '' involve a macroscopic number of conduction electrons of the island . The quantum superposition of charge states can be achieved by tuning the gate voltage U that controls the chemical potential of the island . The charge qubit is typically read-out by electrostatically coupling the island to an extremely sensitive electrometer such as the radio-frequency single-electron transistor ."
Typical T2 coherence times for a charge qubit are on the order of 1–2 µs . [ 5 ] Recent work has shown T2 times approaching 100 µs using a type of charge qubit known as a transmon inside a three-dimensional superconducting cavity . [ 6 ] [ 7 ] Understanding the limits of T2 is an active area of research in the field of superconducting quantum computing .
"Superconducting quantum computing is an implementation of a quantum computer in superconducting electronic circuits . Research in superconducting quantum computing is conducted by Google , [ 1 ] IBM , [ 2 ] IMEC , [ 3 ] BBN Technologies , [ 4 ] Rigetti , [ 5 ] and Intel . [ 6 ] as of May 2016 , up to nine fully controllable qubits are demonstrated in a 1D array , [ 7 ] up to sixteen in a 2D architecture ."
"The devices are typically designed in the radio-frequency spectrum , cooled down in dilution refrigerators below 100mK and addressed with conventional electronic instruments , e.g . frequency synthesizers and spectrum analyzers . Typical dimensions on the scale of micrometers , with sub-micrometer resolution , allow a convenient design of a quantum Hamiltonian with the well-established integrated circuit technology ."
"A distinguishing feature of superconducting quantum circuits is the usage of a Josephson junction - an electrical element non existent in normal conductors . A junction is a weak connection between two leads of a superconducting wire , usually implemented as a thin layer of insulator with a shadow evaporation technique . The condensate wave functions on the two sides of the junction are weakly correlated - they are allowed to have different superconducting phases , contrary to the case of a continuous superconducting wire , where the superconducting wave function must be continuous . The current through the junction occurs by quantum tunneling . This is used to create a non-linear inductance which is essential for qubit design , as it allows a design of anharmonic oscillators . A quantum harmonic oscillator can not be used as a qubit , as there is no way to address only two of its states ."
"In quantum computing , more specifically in superconducting quantum computing , flux qubits ( also known as persistent current qubits ) are micrometer sized loops of superconducting metal that is interrupted by a number of Josephson junctions . These devices function as quantum bits . The flux qubit was first proposed by Terry P. Orlando et al . at MIT in 1999 and fabricated shortly thereafter . [ 1 ] During fabrication , the Josephson junction parameters are engineered so that a persistent current will flow continuously when an external magnetic flux is applied . Only an integer number of flux quanta are allowed to penetrate the superconducting ring , resulting in clockwise or counter-clockwise mesoscopic supercurrents ( typically 300 nA [ 2 ] ) in the loop to compensate ( screen or enhance ) a non-integer external flux bias . When the applied flux through the loop area is close to a half integer number of flux quanta , the two lowest energy eigenstates of the loop will be a quantum superposition of the clockwise and counter-clockwise currents.The two lowest energy eigenstates differ only by the relative quantum phase between the composing current-direction states . Higher energy eigenstates correspond to much larger ( macroscopic ) persistent currents , that induce an additional flux quantum to the qubit loop , thus are well separated energetically from the lowest two eigenstates . This separation , known as the `` qubit non linearity '' criteria , allows operations with the two lowest eigenstates only , effectively creating a two level system . Usually , the two lowest eigenstates will serve as the computational basis for the logical qubit ."
"Computational operations are performed by pulsing the qubit with microwave frequency radiation which has an energy comparable to that of the gap between the energy of the two basis states , similar to RF-SQUID . Properly selected pulse duration and strength can put the qubit into a quantum superposition of the two basis states while subsequent pulses can manipulate the probability weighting that the qubit will be measured in either of the two basis states , thus performing a computational operation ."
"In quantum computing , and more specifically in superconducting quantum computing , the phase qubit is a superconducting device based on the superconductor–insulator–superconductor ( SIS ) Josephson junction , [ 1 ] designed to operate as a quantum bit , or qubit . The phase qubit is closely related , yet distinct from , the flux qubit and the charge qubit , which are also quantum bits implemented by superconducting devices . The major distinction among the three is the ratio of Josephson energy vs charging energy ."
"In quantum computing , and more specifically in superconducting quantum computing , the phase qubit is a superconducting device based on the superconductor–insulator–superconductor ( SIS ) Josephson junction , [ 1 ] designed to operate as a quantum bit , or qubit ."
"The superconducting tunnel junction ( STJ ) — also known as a superconductor–insulator–superconductor tunnel junction ( SIS ) — is an electronic device consisting of two superconductors separated by a very thin layer of insulating material . Current passes through the junction via the process of quantum tunneling . The STJ is a type of Josephson junction , though not all the properties of the STJ are described by the Josephson effect ."
"These devices have a wide range of applications , including high-sensitivity detectors of electromagnetic radiation , magnetometers , high speed digital circuit elements , and quantum computing circuits ."
"The superconducting quantum interference device or SQUID is based on a superconducting loop containing Josephson junctions . SQUIDs are the world 's most sensitive magnetometers , capable of measuring a single magnetic flux quantum ."
"Superconducting quantum computing utilizes STJ-based circuits , including charge qubits , flux qubits and phase qubits ."
The STJ is the primary active element in rapid single flux quantum or RSFQ fast logic circuits .
"The Josephson effect is the phenomenon of supercurrent , a current that flows continuously without any voltage applied , across a device known as a Josephson junction ( JJ ) , which consists of two or more superconductors coupled by a weak link . The weak link can consist of a thin insulating barrier ( known as a superconductor–insulator–superconductor junction , or S-I-S ) , a short section of non-superconducting metal ( S-N-S ) , or a physical constriction that weakens the superconductivity at the point of contact ( S-s-S ) ."
"The Josephson effect is an example of a macroscopic quantum phenomenon . It is named after the British physicist Brian David Josephson , who predicted in 1962 the mathematical relationships for the current and voltage across the weak link . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] The DC Josephson effect had been seen in experiments prior to 1962 , [ 3 ] but had been attributed to `` super-shorts '' or breaches in the insulating barrier leading to the direct conduction of electrons between the superconductors . The first paper to claim the discovery of Josephson 's effect , and to make the requisite experimental checks , was that of Philip Anderson and John Rowell . [ 4 ] These authors were awarded patents on the effects that were never enforced , but never challenged ."
"Before Josephson 's prediction , it was only known that normal ( i.e . non-superconducting ) electrons can flow through an insulating barrier , by means of quantum tunneling . Josephson was the first to predict the tunneling of superconducting Cooper pairs . For this work , Josephson received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1973 . [ 5 ] Josephson junctions have important applications in quantum-mechanical circuits , such as SQUIDs , superconducting qubits , and RSFQ digital electronics . The NIST standard for one volt is achieved by an array of 20,208 Josephson junctions in series ."
"Quantum dots ( QDs ) are semiconductor particles a few nanometres in size , having optical and electronic properties that differ from larger particles due to quantum mechanics . They are a central topic in nanotechnology . When the quantum dots are illuminated by UV light , an electron in the quantum dot can be excited to a state of higher energy . In the case of a semiconducting quantum dot , this process corresponds to the transition of an electron from the valence band to the conductance band . The excited electron can drop back into the valence band releasing its energy by the emission of light . This light emission ( photoluminescence ) is illustrated in the figure on the right . The color of that light depends on the energy difference between the conductance band and the valence band ."
"In the language of materials science , nanoscale semiconductor materials tightly confine either electrons or electron holes . Quantum dots are sometimes referred to as artificial atoms , emphasizing their singularity , having bound , discrete electronic states , like naturally occurring atoms or molecules . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] It was shown that the electronic wave functions in quantum dots resemble the ones in real atoms . [ 3 ] By coupling two or more such quantum dots an artificial molecule can be made , exhibiting hybridization even at room temperature . [ 4 ]"
"Quantum dots have properties intermediate between bulk semiconductors and discrete atoms or molecules . Their optoelectronic properties change as a function of both size and shape . [ 5 ] [ 6 ] Larger QDs of 5–6 nm diameter emit longer wavelengths , with colors such as orange or red . Smaller QDs ( 2–3 nm ) emit shorter wavelengths , yielding colors like blue and green . However , the specific colors vary depending on the exact composition of the QD . [ 7 ]"
"Potential applications of quantum dots include single-electron transistors , solar cells , LEDs , lasers , [ 8 ] single-photon sources , [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] second-harmonic generation , quantum computing , [ 12 ] cell biology research , [ 13 ] and medical imaging . [ 14 ] Their small size allows for some QDs to be suspended in solution , which may lead to use in inkjet printing and spin-coating . [ 15 ] They have been used in Langmuir-Blodgett thin-films . [ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] These processing techniques result in less expensive and less time-consuming methods of semiconductor fabrication ."
"Colloidal quantum dots are also used in inorganic/organic hybrid solar cells . These solar cells are attractive because of the potential for low-cost fabrication and relatively high efficiency . [ 83 ] Incorporation of metal oxides , such as ZnO , TiO2 , and Nb2O5 nanomaterials into organic photovoltaics have been commercialized using full roll-to-roll processing . [ 83 ] A 13.2 % power conversion efficiency is claimed in Si nanowire/PEDOT : PSS hybrid solar cells ."
"Another potential use involves capped single-crystal ZnO nanowires with CdSe quantum dots , immersed in mercaptopropionic acid as hole transport medium in order to obtain a QD-sensitized solar cell . The morphology of the nanowires allowed the electrons to have a direct pathway to the photoanode . This form of solar cell exhibits 50–60 % internal quantum efficiencies . [ 85 ]"
Nanowires with quantum dot coatings on silicon nanowires ( SiNW ) and carbon quantum dots . The use of SiNWs instead of planar silicon enhances the antiflection properties of Si . [ 86 ] The SiNW exhibits a light-trapping effect due to light trapping in the SiNW . This use of SiNWs in conjunction with carbon quantum dots resulted in a solar cell that reached 9.10 % PCE . [ 86 ]
Graphene quantum dots have also been blended with organic electronic materials to improve efficiency and lower cost in photovoltaic devices and organic light emitting diodes ( OLEDs ) in compared to graphene sheets . These graphene quantum dots were functionalized with organic ligands that experience photoluminescence from UV-Vis absorption .
"Several methods are proposed for using quantum dots to improve existing light-emitting diode ( LED ) design , including quantum dot light-emitting diode ( QD-LED or QLED ) displays , and quantum dot white-light-emitting diode ( QD-WLED ) displays . Because quantum dots naturally produce monochromatic light , they can be more efficient than light sources which must be color filtered . QD-LEDs can be fabricated on a silicon substrate , which allows them to be integrated onto standard silicon-based integrated circuits or microelectromechanical systems ."
Quantum dots are valued for displays because they emit light in very specific gaussian distributions . This can result in a display with visibly more accurate colors .
"A conventional color liquid crystal display ( LCD ) is usually backlit by fluorescent lamps ( CCFLs ) or conventional white LEDs that are color filtered to produce red , green , and blue pixels . Quantum dot displays use blue-emitting LEDs rather than white LEDs as the light sources . The converting part of the emitted light is converted into pure green and red light by the corresponding color quantum dots placed in front of the blue LED or using a quantum dot infused diffuser sheet in the backlight optical stack . Blank pixels are also used to allow the blue LED light to still generate blue hues . This type of white light as the backlight of an LCD panel allows for the best color gamut at lower cost than an RGB LED combination using three LEDs . [ 89 ]"
"Another method by which quantum dot displays can be achieved is the electroluminescent ( EL ) or electro-emissive method . This involves embedding quantum dots in each individual pixel . These are then activated and controlled via an electric current application . [ 90 ] Since this is often light emitting itself , the achievable colors may be limited in this method . [ 91 ] Electro-emissive QD-LED TVs exist in laboratories only ."
"The ability of QDs to precisely convert and tune a spectrum makes them attractive for LCD displays . Previous LCD displays can waste energy converting red-green poor , blue-yellow rich white light into a more balanced lighting . By using QDs , only the necessary colors for ideal images are contained in the screen . The result is a screen that is brighter , clearer , and more energy-efficient . The first commercial application of quantum dots was the Sony XBR X900A series of flat panel televisions released in 2013 . [ 92 ]"
"In June 2006 , QD Vision announced technical success in making a proof-of-concept quantum dot display and show a bright emission in the visible and near infra-red region of the spectrum . A QD-LED integrated at a scanning microscopy tip was used to demonstrate fluorescence near-field scanning optical microscopy ( NSOM ) imaging ."
"Quantum dot photodetectors ( QDPs ) can be fabricated either via solution-processing , [ 94 ] or from conventional single-crystalline semiconductors . [ 95 ] Conventional single-crystalline semiconductor QDPs are precluded from integration with flexible organic electronics due to the incompatibility of their growth conditions with the process windows required by organic semiconductors . On the other hand , solution-processed QDPs can be readily integrated with an almost infinite variety of substrates , and also postprocessed atop other integrated circuits . Such colloidal QDPs have potential applications in visible- and infrared-light cameras , [ 96 ] machine vision , industrial inspection , spectroscopy , and fluorescent biomedical imaging ."
"Quantum dots also function as photocatalysts for the light driven chemical conversion of water into hydrogen as a pathway to solar fuel . In photocatalysis , electron hole pairs formed in the dot under band gap excitation drive redox reactions in the surrounding liquid . Generally , the photocatalytic activity of the dots is related to the particle size and its degree of quantum confinement . [ 97 ] This is because the band gap determines the chemical energy that is stored in the dot in the excited state . An obstacle for the use of quantum dots in photocatalysis is the presence of surfactants on the surface of the dots . These surfactants ( or ligands ) interfere with the chemical reactivity of the dots by slowing down mass transfer and electron transfer processes . Also , quantum dots made of metal chalcogenides are chemically unstable under oxidizing conditions and undergo photo corrosion reactions ."
"Semiconductor device fabrication is the process used to manufacture semiconductor devices , typically the metal–oxide–semiconductor ( MOS ) devices used in the integrated circuit ( IC ) chips that are present in everyday electrical and electronic devices . It is a multiple-step sequence of photolithographic and chemical processing steps ( such as surface passivation , thermal oxidation , planar diffusion and junction isolation ) during which electronic circuits are gradually created on a wafer made of pure semiconducting material . Silicon is almost always used , but various compound semiconductors are used for specialized applications ."
"Quantum dots ( QDs ) are semiconductor nanoparticles with a size less than 10 nm . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] They exhibited size-dependent properties especially in the optical absorption and the photoluminescence ( PL ) . Typically , the fluorescence emission peak of the QDs can be tuned by changing their diameters . So far , QDs were consisted of different group elements such as CdTe , CdSe , CdS in the II-VI category , InP or InAs in the III-V category , CuInS2 or AgInS2 in the I–III–VI2 category , and PbSe/PbS in the IV-VI category . These QDs are promising candidates as fluorescent labels in various biological applications such as bioimaging , biosensing and drug delivery ."
"However , most of the QDs in the commercial market are cadmium ( Cd ) -based QDs . Their potential toxicity in the biological environment has been debated over the past decade as the Cd2+ ions released from the QD surface are highly toxic to the cells and tissues . [ 3 ] [ 4 ] Thus , many researchers have focused on the development of cadmium-free quantum dots ( CFQDs ) in the past decade ."
"Carbon quantum dots ( CQDs , C-dots or CDs ) are small carbon nanoparticles ( less than 10 nm in size ) with some form of surface passivation ."
"A dye-sensitized solar cell ( DSSC , DSC , DYSC [ 1 ] or Grätzel cell ) is a low-cost solar cell belonging to the group of thin film solar cells . [ 2 ] It is based on a semiconductor formed between a photo-sensitized anode and an electrolyte , a photoelectrochemical system . The modern version of a dye solar cell , also known as the Grätzel cell , was originally co-invented in 1988 by Brian O'Regan and Michael Grätzel at UC Berkeley [ 3 ] and this work was later developed by the aforementioned scientists at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne ( EPFL ) until the publication of the first high efficiency DSSC in 1991 . [ 4 ] Michael Grätzel has been awarded the 2010 Millennium Technology Prize for this invention ."
"CQDs possess the potential in serving as materials for dye-sensitized solar cells , [ 52 ] organic solar cells , [ 1 ] supercapacitor , [ 53 ] and light emitting devices . [ 54 ] CQDs can be used as photosensitizer in dye-sensitized solar cells and the photoelectric conversion efficiency is significantly enhanced . [ 55 ] CQD incorporated hybrid silica based sol can be used as transparent Fluorescent paint"
"Graphene quantum dots ( GQDs ) are graphene nanoparticles with a size less than 100 nm . Due to their exceptional properties such as low toxicity , stable photoluminescence , chemical stability and pronounced quantum confinement effect , GQDs are considered as a novel material for biological , opto-electronics , energy and environmental applications ."
"Graphene quantum dots are studied as an advanced multifunctional material due to their unique optical , electronic , [ 6 ] spin , [ 27 ] and photoelectric properties induced by the quantum confinement effect and edge effect . They have possible applications in bioimaging , cancer therapeutics , [ 28 ] temperature sensing , [ 29 ] drug delivery , [ 30 ] [ 31 ] LEDs lighter converters , photodetectors , OPV solar cells , and photoluminescent material , biosensors fabrication ."
"A Langmuir–Blodgett ( LB ) film is a nanostructured system formed when Langmuir films—or Langmuir monolayers ( LM ) —are transferred from the liquid-gas interface to solid supports during the vertical passage of the support through the monolayers . LB films can contain one or more monolayers of an organic material , deposited from the surface of a liquid onto a solid by immersing ( or emersing ) the solid substrate into ( or from ) the liquid . A monolayer is adsorbed homogeneously with each immersion or emersion step , thus films with very accurate thickness can be formed . This thickness is accurate because the thickness of each monolayer is known and can therefore be added to find the total thickness of a Langmuir–Blodgett film ."
"Quantum dot cellular automata ( sometimes referred to simply as quantum cellular automata , or QCA ) are a proposed improvement on conventional computer design ( CMOS ) , which have been devised in analogy to conventional models of cellular automata introduced by John von Neumann ."
"A quantum dot display is a display device that uses quantum dots ( QD ) , semiconductor nanocrystals which can produce pure monochromatic red , green , and blue light ."
"Photo-emissive quantum dot particles are used in a QD layer which uses the blue light from a backlight to emit pure basic colors which improve display brightness and color gamut by reducing light losses and color crosstalk in RGB LCD color filters , replacing traditional colored photoresists in RGB LCD color filters . This technology is used in LED-backlit LCDs , though it is applicable to other display technologies which use color filters , such as blue/UV OLED or MicroLED . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] LED-backlit LCDs are the main application of quantum dots , where they are used to offer an alternative to OLED displays ."
"Electro-emissive or electroluminiscent quantum dot displays are an experimental type of display based on quantum-dot light-emitting diodes ( QD-LED ; also EL-QLED , ELQD , QDEL ) . These displays are similar to active-matrix organic light-emitting diode ( AMOLED ) and MicroLED displays , in that light would be produced directly in each pixel by applying electric current to inorganic nano-particles . QD-LED displays could support large , flexible displays and would not degrade as readily as OLEDs , making them good candidates for flat-panel TV screens , digital cameras , mobile phones and handheld game consoles . [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ]"
"As of 2019 , all commercial products , such as LCD TVs using quantum dots and branded as QLED , use photo-emissive particles . Electro-emissive QD-LED TVs exist in laboratories only , although Samsung is working to release Electro-emissive QDLED displays `` in the near future '' , [ 7 ] while others [ 8 ] doubt that such QDLED displays will ever become mainstream ."
"A quantum dot laser is a semiconductor laser that uses quantum dots as the active laser medium in its light emitting region . Due to the tight confinement of charge carriers in quantum dots , they exhibit an electronic structure similar to atoms . Lasers fabricated from such an active media exhibit device performance that is closer to gas lasers , and avoid some of the negative aspects of device performance associated with traditional semiconductor lasers based on bulk or quantum well active media . Improvements in modulation bandwidth , lasing threshold , relative intensity noise , linewidth enhancement factor and temperature insensitivity have all been observed . The quantum dot active region may also be engineered to operate at different wavelengths by varying dot size and composition . This allows quantum dot lasers to be fabricated to operate at wavelengths previously not possible using semiconductor laser technology ."
"Recently , devices based on quantum dot active media are finding commercial application in medicine ( laser scalpel , optical coherence tomography ) , display technologies ( projection , laser TV ) , spectroscopy and telecommunications . A 10 Gbit/s quantum dot laser that is insensitive to temperature fluctuation for use in optical data communications and optical networks has been developed using this technology . The laser is capable of high-speed operation at 1.3 µm wavelengths , at temperatures from 20 °C to 70 °C . It works in optical data transmission systems , optical LANs and metro-access systems . In comparison to the performance of conventional strained quantum-well lasers of the past , the new quantum dot laser achieves significantly higher stability of temperature ."
"A quantum dot single-photon source is based on a single quantum dot placed in an optical cavity . It is an on-demand single-photon source . A laser pulse can excite a pair of carriers known as an exciton in the quantum dot . The decay of a single exciton due to spontaneous emission leads to the emission of a single photon . Due to interactions between excitons , the emission when the quantum dot contains a single exciton is energetically distinct from that when the quantum dot contains more than one exciton . Therefore , a single exciton can be deterministically created by a laser pulse and the quantum dot becomes a nonclassical light source that emits photons one by one and thus shows photon antibunching . The emission of single photons can be proven by measuring the second order intensity correlation function . The spontaneous emission rate of the emitted photons can be enhanced by integrating the quantum dot in an optical cavity . Additionally , the cavity leads to emission in a well-defined optical mode increasing the efficiency of the photon source ."
"A quantum dot solar cell ( QDSC ) is a solar cell design that uses quantum dots as the absorbing photovoltaic material . It attempts to replace bulk materials such as silicon , copper indium gallium selenide ( CIGS ) or cadmium telluride ( CdTe ) . Quantum dots have bandgaps that are tunable across a wide range of energy levels by changing their size . In bulk materials , the bandgap is fixed by the choice of material ( s ) . This property makes quantum dots attractive for multi-junction solar cells , where a variety of materials are used to improve efficiency by harvesting multiple portions of the solar spectrum ."
"A quantum well is a potential well with only discrete energy values..A wide variety of electronic quantum well devices have been developed based on the theory of quantum well systems . These devices have found applications in lasers , photodetectors , modulators , and switches for example . Compared to conventional devices , quantum well devices are much faster and operate much more economically and are a point of incredible importance to the technological and telecommunication industries . These quantum well devices are currently replacing many , if not all , conventional electrical components in many electronic devices ."
"Quantum networks form an important element of quantum computing and quantum communication systems . Quantum networks facilitate the transmission of information in the form of quantum bits , also called qubits , between physically separated quantum processors . A quantum processor is a small quantum computer being able to perform quantum logic gates on a certain number of qubits . Quantum networks work in a similar way to classical networks . The main difference is that quantum networking , like quantum computing , is better at solving certain problems , such as modeling quantum systems ."
"In quantum information theory , a quantum circuit is a model for quantum computation in which a computation is a sequence of quantum gates , which are reversible transformations on a quantum mechanical analog of an n-bit register . This analogous structure is referred to as an n-qubit register . The graphical depiction of quantum circuit elements is described using a variant of the Penrose graphical notation ."
"Quantum key distribution ( QKD ) is a secure communication method which implements a cryptographic protocol involving components of quantum mechanics . It enables two parties to produce a shared random secret key known only to them , which can then be used to encrypt and decrypt messages . It is often incorrectly called quantum cryptography , as it is the best-known example of a quantum cryptographic task ."
"Quantum teleportation is a technique for transferring quantum information from a sender at one location to a receiver some distance away . While teleportation is commonly portrayed in science fiction as a means to transfer physical objects from one location to the next , quantum teleportation only transfers quantum information . Moreover , the sender may not know the location of the recipient , and does not know which particular quantum state will be transferred ."
