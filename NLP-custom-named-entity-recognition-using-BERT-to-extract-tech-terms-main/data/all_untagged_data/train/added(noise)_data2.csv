Throw in the throwaway cuts of meat as part of the hands ' take-home pay , and let cowboy ingenuity go to work.Grill skirt steak ( faja in Spanish ) over the campfire , wrap in a tortilla , and you 've got the beginning of a Rio Grande region tradition .

Do n't forget the Altoids.Unlike Atlantic salmon , which is 99.8 % farmed , Alaska salmon is wild , which means the fish live free and eat clean -- all the better to glaze with Dijon mustard or real maple syrup . Alaska salmon season coincides with their return to spawning streams ( guided by an amazing sense of smell to the exact spot where they were born ) .Panko bread crumbs : My go-to bread crumbs .

Or you can do this with a pairing knife ( just be careful not to cut through peppers bottom side ) .It 's hard to think about fashion without talking about the trends that come in and out of the limelight . But at the foundation of it all are the wardrobe basics that never go out of style . Case in point : white T-shirts.Whether you consider yourself a peak minimalist -- with a uniform of closet staples like vintage-inspired high-waist jeans and classic black boots -- or describe your style as that of an all-out maximalist , there will always ( and we mean always ) be a spot , or section , for the perfect white tee . Among her childhood artistic inspirations , spoken word artist and singer I.M.F . recalls visitors at her school assemblies .
