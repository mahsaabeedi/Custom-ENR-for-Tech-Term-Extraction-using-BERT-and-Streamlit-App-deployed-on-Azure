"Daily global carbon dioxide emissions dropped 17 percent, from about 100 million metric tons to about 83 million metric tons, in early April compared with average daily emissions in 2019, researchers report May 19 in Nature Climate Change. So climate scientist Corinne Le Qur of the University of East Anglia in Norwich, England, and colleagues used daily data such as electricity demand, city congestion and readouts from smart meters in homes to estimate emissions for 69 countries. If the world returns to a pre-pandemic level of activity by mid-June, the researchers say, 2020s emissions will be about 4 percent lower than in 2019. To limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2100, nations would need to reduce emissions by 7.6 percent each year over the next decade, scientists say.

"A new study applies ""unfolding,"" or error-correction techniques used for particle detectors, to problems with noise in quantum computing. S. Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) has successfully adapted and applied a common error-reduction technique to the field of quantum computing. The problems of noise and physical defects, and the need for error-correction and error-mitigation algorithms, which reduce the frequency and severity of errors, are also common in the fledgling field of quantum computing, and a study published in the journal npj Quantum Information found that there appear to be some common solutions, too. Ben Nachman, a Berkeley Lab physicist who is involved with particle physics experiments at CERN as a member of Berkeley Lab's ATLAS group, saw the quantum-computing connection while working on a particle physics calculation with Christian Bauer, a Berkeley Lab theoretical physicist who is a co-author of the study. To cope with this incredibly busy, ""noisy"" environment and intrinsic problems related to the energy resolution and other factors associated with detectors, physicists use error-correcting ""unfolding"" techniques and other filters to winnow down this particle jumble to the most useful, accurate data. The latest study focuses on a technique to reduce readout errors, called ""iterative Bayesian unfolding"" (IBU), which is familiar to the high-energy physics community. ""We took a very common technique from high-energy physics, and applied it to quantum computing, and it worked really wellas it should,"" Nachman said. ""It's exciting to see how the plethora of knowledge the high-energy physics community has developed to get the most out of noisy experiments can be used to get more out of noisy quantum computers,"" de Jong said. "" He noted that quantum computing provided a ""push to think about problems in a new way,"" adding, ""It has opened up new science potential.

"To create the battery , the researchers used a proprietary cathode design and chemistry from ZPower . Meng and her colleagues provided their expertise in advanced characterization for electrochemical energy storage systems and characterized each iteration of the battery prototype until it reached peak performance . The battery 's exceptional energy density is due to its silver oxide zinc , ( AgO Zn ) chemistry . This limits their use to low power , disposable electronics . As an added benefit , the AgO Zn chemistry is responsible for the battery 's low impedance . By testing various solvents and binders , researchers in Wang 's lab at UC San Diego were able to find an ink formulation that makes AgO viable for printing .

"Users pay fees to miners for processing transactions on the blockchain. Bitcoins block size is 1 MB, which means miners can process only 1 MB worth of transactions per block mined roughly every 10 minutes. Network congestion, as represented by bitcoins memory pool or its collection of unconfirmed transactions on the blockchain, has been on a declining trend since topping out at the 28-month high of 267,608 on May 18 with a total block size of 78.5 MB, as per data source Bitcoin Visuals. This forced users to increase their mining fee, so they can jump ahead in line to have their transactions confirmed quicker, said Chen. The recent decline in fees could also be associated with the downward adjustment in the mining difficulty and the resulting drop in block interval time. The mean block time had jumped by nearly 150% immediately after halving, forcing miners to charge higher fees."

"Some investors use beta as a measure of how much a certain stock is impacted by market risk (volatility). Looking at the last five years, Inca One Gold has a beta of 1.22. The fact that this is well above 1 indicates that its share price movements have shown sensitivity to overall market volatility. Inca One Gold is a noticeably small company, with a market capitalisation of CA$12m. Because it takes less capital to move the share price of a small company like this, when a stock this size is actively traded it is quite often more sensitive to market volatility than similar large companies. Since Inca One Gold tends to move up when the market is going up, and down when its going down, potential investors may wish to reflect on the overall market, when considering the stock."

"Hong-Kun Cao, Yong-Seok Hwang, Eun-Soo Kim, and Xin Jin, ""Compact full-color holographic 3-D display based on undersampled computer-generated holograms and oblique projection imaging,"" Opt. Express 28, 35910-35926 (2020). For its realization, undersampling conditions of the CGH enabling the complete recovery of image information are derived, and the OPI-based longitudinal-to-lateral depth conversion (LTL-DC) scheme allowing the simple reconstruction of full-color images is also proposed. Three-color off-axis US-CGHs are generated with their center-shifted principle fringe patterns (CS-PFPs) of the novel look-up table (NLUT) method, where center-shifts are calculated with the derived undersampling conditions of the CGH based on the generalized sampling theorem, and then multiplexed into the color-multiplexed hologram (CMH). The CMH is loaded on a SLM (spatial light modulator) and reconstructed by being illuminated with a multi-wavelength light source, where an original full-color image is reconstructed being spatially separated from the other color-dispersed images on the projected image plane with the OPI-based LTL-DC process, which enables us to view the original full-color image just with a simple filter mask. Here it must be noted that in case the calculated CMH is loaded on a SLM and directly reconstructed by being illuminated with the multi-wavelength light source, not only three original color images, but six kinds of color-dispersed images are also reconstructed along the longitudinal direction with their depths due to the CDs. All those longitudinal images, which are different in depth and color, would be viewed to the observer as a noise-like mixture of color images at the output plane. Meanwhile, from this undersampled CMH, a set of original full-color and color-dispersed images with their depths can be reconstructed along the optic-axis whose axis is laterally shifted from its origin depending on the angle of the reference beam from the object. Accordingly, in this paper, a novel type of the compact full-color electro-holographic 3-D display is proposed based on the undersampled computer-generated holograms (US-CGHs) and oblique projection imaging (OPI)-based longitudinal-to-lateral depth conversion (LTL-DC) scheme."

"A hacker can reproduce a circuit on a chip by discovering what key transistors are doing in a circuit but not if the transistor `` type '' is undetectable .

"Employers struggling to meet the conditions set by the U.S. governments loan program may find salvation in an unlikely place: a new bitcoin 401(k) plan from Bitwage. Calling the product a world first, the crypto payroll company said Tuesday it had successfully trialed its bitcoin 401(k) employee pension account and would start offering the plan to companies  especially those trying to meet the 75% payroll requirement in the federal Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). To incentivize staff retention, the program offers 100% loan forgiveness if employers spend at least 75% of funds received on payroll expenses. Together with the PPP program, the Bitwage Bitcoin 401(k) Plan allows employers to get more out of their PPP loans, while providing their employees new and innovative investment options. . Although Bitwages plan is geared toward employers interested in offering bitcoin, employees can also choose to gain exposure to traditional asset classes too, including equities and bonds, via its link-up with Leading Retirement Solutions."

"The Montana Supreme Court this week ruled that fossils are not legally the same as minerals such as gold or copper. It appears to defuse a potentially explosive 2018 ruling by the federal Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals that fossils went to the owners of mineral rights. But an appeals court panel ruled two to one that fossils went with the owners of mineral rights. Although the case now goes back to the federal appellate court, We believe that that effectively resolves the issue, Krogh says of the new ruling. It could also clear the way for the final sale of the Dueling Dinosaurs. The Murrays have an agreement to sell the paired fossils to a U.S.-based museum, Krogh says. This deal is more good news for scientists, who feared the distinctive fossils would be bought by a private collector, keeping it from the public and researchers, Polly says."

"Most IoT devices have vulnerabilities that leave them open to DDoS attacks, according to Bitdefenders telemetry. If the device has vulnerabilities, which is a safe bet for many of them, it could potentially be used (or at least compromised) by attackers. Especially if there are many smart devices, theyd need assistance from an intelligent security solution that can detect connected devices  such as the Bitdefender IoT Security Platform. Through this technology, the vulnerable devices in a home are indexed, and the user is notified. Most vulnerabilities in IoT devices allow for denial of service attacks (46.7%), followed by buffer overflows (18.18%), gaining information (17.41%), arbitrary code execution (14.39%), and privilege escalation (10.51%). Ideally, users protection should be covered by the ISP through home gateways with security capabilities, such as those provided by the BitdefenderIoT Security Platform. Smart home security is something that every network operator should have in their portfolio, showing users their commitment to better online experiences for us all."

"In materials science, interactions between dipolar forces of permanent magnets can lead to form one-dimensional chains and rings. In a new report on Science Advances, Leon Abelmann and a research team in electronic components, technology and materials at the Saarland University, University of Twente and Delft University of Technology in Germany and Netherlands investigated the possibility of allowing dipoles to self-assemble into 3-D structures by encapsulating them in a shell of a specific shape. studied the possibility of self-assembling crystals under permanent magnetic dipolar forces. Therefore, provided there was no preference for parallel or antiparallel alignment, the experimental setup could self-assemble 3-D structures based on dipolar forces. In this way, Leon Abelmann and colleagues experimentally demonstrated the capacity for 3-D structures to self-assemble from dipolar forces, provided there was no preference for parallel or antiparallel alignment."
"Living cells inside the body could be placed under surveillancetheir location and migration noninvasively tracked in real time over many daysusing a new method developed by researchers at KAUST. The technique uses magnetic core-shell iron nanowires as nontoxic contrast agents, which can be implanted into live cells, lighting up those cells' location inside a living organism when scanned by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). ""Cell labeling and tracking has become an invaluable tool for scientific and clinical applications,"" says Aldo Martnez-Banderas, a Ph.D. student in Kosel's team. ""The strong magnetization of the nanowires enabled the detection of approximately 10 labeled cells within the brain of a mouse for a period of at least 40 days, which allowed us to trace their exact location and fate in the animal,"" Martnez-Banderas says.

Vladimir Prelog Weg 1, 8093 Zrich, Switzerland. . . b. Laboratory for Multifunctional Materials, Department of Materials, ETH Zrich, Vladimir Prelog Weg 1, 8093 Zrich,. Rare earth doped upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) show great promise in a range of applications, including biological imaging and sensing, solar cells and security inks. Although their emission color can be tuned widely as a function of host matrix and dopant composition, the high dimensionality of the associated parameter space and the sensitivity of emission to these parameters make optimization and precision tuning difficult. Herein, we present a new time efficient synthetic route to NaYF. Er,Tm UCNPs and a highthroughput microfluidic reactor to synthesize and precisely tune the emission characteristics of the particles. We synthesize a range of particles with optimized emission intensity and wide color distribution by changing the doping degree of sensitizer Yb to provide for green orange tunability, and the ratio of TmEr to give greenblue tunability. With the two tunable dimensions, we realize true white light emitting UCNPs based on optimized red, green and blue (RGB) emission ratios from a single composition.

"Here are the latest Insider stories. SPONSORED BY Advertiser Name Here. Researchers aim to increase the lifespan of sensors and IoT devices by using AI and energy-harvesting technology. IoT sensors can't collect or transmit data without power. But while ambient energy can be harvested, it's not a reliable replacement for battery power. The project uses piggyback sensors, which are powered by energy harvested from the environment, to trigger the main sensors. The piggyback sensors will run unattended and are trained, using AI algorithms, to signal the main devices to turn on only when specific event conditions are met. ""One of the main challenges of running AI algorithms with energy harvested from the environment is that the energy from the environment is intermittent,"" said Jingtong Hu, lead researcher on the study and associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at the university's Swanson School of Engineering, in an article on the university's website. "" The principal data-collection sensors and their radios will still require a battery supply, but power use will be reduced if they're only engaged during specific events. 2. DNNs usually require multiple execution episodes to obtain one inference result and it may take indefinite amount of time due to the weak and unpredictable harvested power. To address these challenges, this project is developing multi-exit DNNs, which can output incrementally accurate inference results during each execution episode. ""The researchers outlined three tasks they plan to tackle to lay the foundation for conducting intermittent incremental inference on IoT devices powered by energy-harvesting technology:""First, novel power trace aware compression, online pruning and adaptation algorithms will be developed to ensure efficient deployment of multi-exit DNNs on intermittently-powered devices. Second, new multi-exit statistical and incremental neural networks (MESI-NN) will be developed to further reduce the latency and improve the accuracy and energy efficiency."

"5G appears set to join other 21st century technologies that are transformative, such as bitcoin mining, artificial intelligence and cloud computing/data centres, but also energy hungry. In the case of 5G, it is not that the technology itself is energy inefficient. Over time, each successive generation of mobile technology has become more energy efficient measured in terms of kilowatthours per gigabyte. The challenge is the growth in use cases, which is set to increase the energy use and costs for operators, according to a new study from GSMA Intelligence, the intelligence arm of the global mobile operators association GSMA. Currently energy use accounts for the majority of network costs, almost a quarter of the total behind selling, general and administrative (SGA). In turn this usage accounts for the majority of operators overall energy usage, approaching 90% or more in the case of the largest operators. Combined with the rising costs of spectrum, capital investment and ongoing maintenance/upgrades, this means energy saving measures in network operations are necessary rather than nice to have. . The report, 5G energy efficiencies: Green is the new black, says that mobile data traffic, estimated at 6. The report identifies several measures to improve efficiency alongside technical improvements to reduce energy leakage as power passes through the network phases. The big picture for operators of ultimately reducing emissions to net zero depends on wrapping energy efficient technologies into a broader green strategy that encompasses all facets of operations, the report advises  a recommendation as applicable to other sectors as to mobile operators.

"In recent years , it has become possible to use laser beams and electron beams to `` print '' engineering objects with complex shapes that could not be achieved by conventional manufacturing . The additive manufacturing ( AM ) process , or 3D printing , for metallic materials involves melting and fusing fine scale powder particles each about 10 times finer than a grain of beach sand in sub millimeter scale `` pools '' created by focusing a laser or electron beam on the material . `` The highly focused beams provide exquisite control , enabling 'tuning ' of properties in critical locations of the printed object , . . Unfortunately , many advanced metallic alloys used in extreme heatintensive and chemically corrosive environments encountered in energy , space and nuclear applications are not compatible with the AM process . `` . The challenge of discovering new AM compatible materials was irresistible for Pollock , a world renowned scientist who conducts research on advanced metallic materials and coatings . . because a suite of highly compatible alloys could transform the production of metallic materials having high economic value i. ."
