"Genetic engineering , also called genetic modification or genetic manipulation , is the direct manipulation of an organism 's genes using biotechnology . It is a set of technologies used to change the genetic makeup of cells , including the transfer of genes within and across species boundaries to produce improved or novel organisms . New DNA is obtained by either isolating and copying the genetic material of interest using recombinant DNA methods or by artificially synthesising the DNA . A construct is usually created and used to insert this DNA into the host organism . The first recombinant DNA molecule was made by Paul Berg in 1972 by combining DNA from the monkey virus SV40 with the lambda virus . As well as inserting genes , the process can be used to remove , or `` knock out '' , genes . The new DNA can be inserted randomly , or targeted to a specific part of the genome ."
"A GM salmon , awaiting regulatory approval [ 155 ] [ 156 ] [ 5 ] since 1997 , [ 157 ] was approved for human consumption by the American FDA in November 2015 , to be raised in specific land-based hatcheries in Canada and Panama ."
"Creating genetically modified food is a multi-step process . The first step is to identify a useful gene from another organism that you would like to add . The gene can be taken from a cell [ 51 ] or artificially synthesised , [ 52 ] and then combined with other genetic elements , including a promoter and terminator region and a selectable marker . [ 53 ] Then the genetic elements are inserted into the targets genome . DNA is generally inserted into animal cells using microinjection , where it can be injected through the cell 's nuclear envelope directly into the nucleus , or through the use of viral vectors . [ 54 ] In plants the DNA is often inserted using Agrobacterium-mediated recombination , [ 55 ] [ 56 ] biolistics [ 57 ] or electroporation . As only a single cell is transformed with genetic material , the organism must be regenerated from that single cell . In plants this is accomplished through tissue culture . [ 58 ] [ 59 ] In animals it is necessary to ensure that the inserted DNA is present in the embryonic stem cells . [ 55 ] Further testing using PCR , Southern hybridization , and DNA sequencing is conducted to confirm that an organism contains the new gene . [ 60 ]"
"Traditionally the new genetic material was inserted randomly within the host genome . Gene targeting techniques , which creates double-stranded breaks and takes advantage on the cells natural homologous recombination repair systems , have been developed to target insertion to exact locations . Genome editing uses artificially engineered nucleases that create breaks at specific points . There are four families of engineered nucleases : meganucleases , [ 61 ] [ 62 ] zinc finger nucleases , [ 63 ] [ 64 ] transcription activator-like effector nucleases ( TALENs ) , [ 65 ] [ 66 ] and the Cas9-guideRNA system ( adapted from CRISPR ) . [ 67 ] [ 68 ] TALEN and CRISPR are the two most commonly used and each has its own advantages . [ 69 ] TALENs have greater target specificity , while CRISPR is easier to design and more efficient ."
"Genetic engineering can be accomplished using multiple techniques . There are a number of steps that are followed before a genetically modified organism ( GMO ) is created . Genetic engineers must first choose what gene they wish to insert , modify , or delete . The gene must then be isolated and incorporated , along with other genetic elements , into a suitable vector . This vector is then used to insert the gene into the host genome , creating a transgenic or edited organism . The ability to genetically engineer organisms is built on years of research and discovery on how genes function and how we can manipulate them . Important advances included the discovery of restriction enzymes and DNA ligases and the development of polymerase chain reaction and sequencing ."
"This allowed the gene of interest to be isolated and then incorporated into a vector . Often a promoter and terminator region was added as well as a selectable marker gene . The gene may be modified further at this point to make it express more efficiently . This vector is then inserted into the host organism 's genome . For animals , the gene is typically inserted into embryonic stem cells , while in plants it can be inserted into any tissue that can be cultured into a fully developed plant . Common techniques include microinjection , virus-mediated , Agrobacterium-mediated or biolistics . Further tests are carried out on the resulting organism to ensure stable integration , inheritance and expression . First generation offspring are heterozygous , requiring them to be inbred to create the homozygous pattern necessary for stable inheritance . Homozygosity must be confirmed in second generation specimens ."
"Traditional techniques inserted the genes randomly into the host 's genome . Advances have allowed genes to be inserted at specific locations within a genome , which reduces the unintended side effects of random insertion . Early targeting systems relied on meganucleases and zinc finger nucleases . Since 2009 more accurate and easier systems to implement have been developed . Transcription activator-like effector nucleases ( TALENs ) and the Cas9-guideRNA system ( adapted from CRISPR ) are the two most commonly used . They may potentially be useful in gene therapy and other procedures that require accurate or high throughput targeting ."
"Finding that a recombinant organism contains the inserted genes is not usually sufficient to ensure that they will be appropriately expressed in the intended tissues . Further testing using PCR , Southern hybridization , and DNA sequencing is conducted to confirm that an organism contains the new gene . [ 49 ] These tests can also confirm the chromosomal location and copy number of the inserted gene . Once confirmed methods that look for and measure the gene products ( RNA and protein ) are also used to assess gene expression , transcription , RNA processing patterns and expression and localization of protein product ( s ) . These include northern hybridisation , quantitative RT-PCR , Western blot , immunofluorescence , ELISA and phenotypic analysis . [ 50 ] When appropriate , the organism 's offspring are studied to confirm that the transgene and associated phenotype are stably inherited ."
"Genome editing uses artificially engineered nucleases that create specific double-stranded breaks at desired locations in the genome . The breaks are subject to cellular DNA repair processes that can be exploited for targeted gene knock-out , correction or insertion at high frequencies . If a donor DNA containing the appropriate sequence ( homologies ) is present , then new genetic material containing the transgene will be integrated at the targeted site with high efficiency by homologous recombination . [ 53 ] There are four families of engineered nucleases : meganucleases , [ 54 ] [ 55 ] ZFNs , [ 56 ] [ 57 ] transcription activator-like effector nucleases ( TALEN ) , [ 58 ] [ 59 ] the CRISPR/Cas ( clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat/CRISPRassociated protein ( e.g . CRISPR/Cas9 ) . [ 60 ] [ 61 ] Among the four types , TALEN and CRISPR/Cas are the two most commonly used . [ 62 ] Recent advances have looked at combining multiple systems to exploit the best features of both ( e.g . megaTAL that are a fusion of a TALE DNA binding domain and a meganuclease ) . [ 63 ] Recent research has also focused on developing strategies to create gene knock-out or corrections without creating double stranded breaks ( base editors ) ."
"Access to the code governing the DNA recognition by transcription activator-like effectors ( TALE ) in 2009 opened the way to the development of a new class of efficient TAL-based gene editing tools . TALE , proteins secreted by the Xanthomonas plant pathogen , bind with great specificity to genes within the plant host and initiate transcription of the genes helping infection . Engineering TALE by fusing the DNA binding core to the FokI nuclease catalytic domain allowed creation of a new tool of designer nucleases , the TALE nuclease ( TALEN ) . [ 67 ] They have one of the greatest specificities of all the current engineered nucleases . Due to the presence of repeat sequences , they are difficult to construct through standard molecular biology procedure and rely on more complicated method of such as Golden gate cloning . [ 62 ]"
"In 2011 , another major breakthrough technology was developed based on CRISPR/Cas ( clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat / CRISPR associated protein ) systems that function as an adaptive immune system in bacteria and archaea . The CRISPR/Cas system allows bacteria and archaea to fight against invading viruses by cleaving viral DNA and inserting pieces of that DNA into their own genome . The organism then transcribes this DNA into RNA and combines this RNA with Cas9 proteins to make double-stranded breaks in the invading viral DNA . The RNA serves as a guide RNA to direct the Cas9 enzyme to the correct spot in the virus DNA . By pairing Cas proteins with a designed guide RNA CRISPR/Cas9 can be used to induce double-stranded breaks at specific points within DNA sequences . The break gets repaired by cellular DNA repair enzymes , creating a small insertion/deletion type mutation in most cases . Targeted DNA repair is possible by providing a donor DNA template that represents the desired change and that is ( sometimes ) used for double-strand break repair by homologous recombination . It was later demonstrated that CRISPR/Cas9 can edit human cells in a dish . Although the early generation lacks the specificity of TALEN , the major advantage of this technology is the simplicity of the design . It also allows multiple sites to be targeted simultaneously , allowing the editing of multiple genes at once . CRISPR/Cpf1 is a more recently discovered system that requires a different guide RNA to create particular double-stranded breaks ( leaves overhangs when cleaving the DNA ) when compared to CRISPR/Cas9 . [ 62 ]"
"CRISPR/Cas9 is efficient at gene disruption . The creation of HIV-resistant babies by Chinese researcher He Jiankui is perhaps the most famous example of gene disruption using this method . [ 68 ] It is far less effective at gene correction . Methods of base editing are under development in which a “ nuclease-dead ” Cas 9 endonuclease or a related enzyme is used for gene targeting while a linked deaminase enzyme makes a targeted base change in the DNA . [ 69 ] The most recent refinement of CRISPR-Cas9 is called Prime Editing . This method links a reverse transcriptase to an RNA-guided engineered nuclease that only makes single-strand cuts but no double-strand breaks . It replaces the portion of DNA next to the cut by the successive action of nuclease and reverse transcriptase , introducing the desired change from an RNA template ."
"In genetic engineering , a gene gun or biolistic particle delivery system is a device used to deliver exogenous DNA ( transgenes ) , RNA , or protein to cells . By coating particles of a heavy metal with a gene of interest and firing these micro-projectiles into cells using mechanical force , an integration of desired genetic information can be induced into cells . The technique involved with such micro-projectile delivery of DNA is often referred to as biolistics . [ 1 ]"
"This device is able to transform almost any type of cell and is not limited to the transformation of the nucleus ; it can also transform organelles , including plastids and mitochondria ."
A Southern blot is a method used in molecular biology for detection of a specific DNA sequence in DNA samples . Southern blotting combines transfer of electrophoresis-separated DNA fragments to a filter membrane and subsequent fragment detection by probe hybridization .
"DNA sequencing is the process of determining the nucleic acid sequence – the order of nucleotides in DNA . It includes any method or technology that is used to determine the order of the four bases : adenine , guanine , cytosine , and thymine . The advent of rapid DNA sequencing methods has greatly accelerated biological and medical research and discovery ."
"RNA sequencing was one of the earliest forms of nucleotide sequencing . The major landmark of RNA sequencing is the sequence of the first complete gene and the complete genome of Bacteriophage MS2 , identified and published by Walter Fiers and his coworkers at the University of Ghent ( Ghent , Belgium ) , in 1972 [ 23 ] and 1976 . [ 24 ] Traditional RNA sequencing methods require the creation of a cDNA molecule which must be sequenced ."
"On 1 April 1997 , Pascal Mayer and Laurent Farinelli submitted patents to the World Intellectual Property Organization describing DNA colony sequencing . [ 50 ] The DNA sample preparation and random surface-polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) arraying methods described in this patent , coupled to Roger Tsien et al . 's `` base-by-base '' sequencing method , is now implemented in Illumina 's Hi-Seq genome sequencers ."
"Lynx Therapeutics published and marketed massively parallel signature sequencing ( MPSS ) , in 2000 . This method incorporated a parallelized , adapter/ligation-mediated , bead-based sequencing technology and served as the first commercially available `` next-generation '' sequencing method , though no DNA sequencers were sold to independent laboratories ."
"Maxam-Gilbert sequencing requires radioactive labeling at one 5 ' end of the DNA and purification of the DNA fragment to be sequenced . Chemical treatment then generates breaks at a small proportion of one or two of the four nucleotide bases in each of four reactions ( G , A+G , C , C+T ) . The concentration of the modifying chemicals is controlled to introduce on average one modification per DNA molecule . Thus a series of labeled fragments is generated , from the radiolabeled end to the first `` cut '' site in each molecule . The fragments in the four reactions are electrophoresed side by side in denaturing acrylamide gels for size separation . To visualize the fragments , the gel is exposed to X-ray film for autoradiography , yielding a series of dark bands each corresponding to a radiolabeled DNA fragment , from which the sequence may be inferred ."
"Most sequencing approaches use an in vitro cloning step to amplify individual DNA molecules , because their molecular detection methods are not sensitive enough for single molecule sequencing . Emulsion PCR [ 59 ] isolates individual DNA molecules along with primer-coated beads in aqueous droplets within an oil phase . A polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) then coats each bead with clonal copies of the DNA molecule followed by immobilization for later sequencing . Emulsion PCR is used in the methods developed by Marguilis et al . ( commercialized by 454 Life Sciences ) , Shendure and Porreca et al . ( also known as `` polony sequencing '' ) and SOLiD sequencing , ( developed by Agencourt , later Applied Biosystems , now Life Technologies ) . [ 60 ] [ 61 ] [ 62 ] Emulsion PCR is also used in the GemCode and Chromium platforms developed by 10x Genomics ."
"Shotgun sequencing is a sequencing method designed for analysis of DNA sequences longer than 1000 base pairs , up to and including entire chromosomes . This method requires the target DNA to be broken into random fragments . After sequencing individual fragments , the sequences can be reassembled on the basis of their overlapping regions ."
"High-throughput sequencing , which includes next-generation `` short-read '' and third-generation `` long-read '' sequencing methods , [ nt 1 ] applies to exome sequencing , genome sequencing , genome resequencing , transcriptome profiling ( RNA-Seq ) , DNA-protein interactions ( ChIP-sequencing ) , and epigenome characterization . [ 65 ] Resequencing is necessary , because the genome of a single individual of a species will not indicate all of the genome variations among other individuals of the same species ."
Single molecule real time ( SMRT ) sequencing
Main article : Single molecule real time sequencing
"SMRT sequencing is based on the sequencing by synthesis approach . The DNA is synthesized in zero-mode wave-guides ( ZMWs ) – small well-like containers with the capturing tools located at the bottom of the well . The sequencing is performed with use of unmodified polymerase ( attached to the ZMW bottom ) and fluorescently labelled nucleotides flowing freely in the solution . The wells are constructed in a way that only the fluorescence occurring by the bottom of the well is detected . The fluorescent label is detached from the nucleotide upon its incorporation into the DNA strand , leaving an unmodified DNA strand . According to Pacific Biosciences ( PacBio ) , the SMRT technology developer , this methodology allows detection of nucleotide modifications ( such as cytosine methylation ) . This happens through the observation of polymerase kinetics . This approach allows reads of 20,000 nucleotides or more , with average read lengths of 5 kilobases . [ 80 ] [ 90 ] In 2015 , Pacific Biosciences announced the launch of a new sequencing instrument called the Sequel System , with 1 million ZMWs compared to 150,000 ZMWs in the PacBio RS II instrument . [ 91 ] [ 92 ] SMRT sequencing is referred to as `` third-generation '' or `` long-read '' sequencing ."
Nanopore DNA sequencing
Main article : Nanopore sequencing
"The DNA passing through the nanopore changes its ion current . This change is dependent on the shape , size and length of the DNA sequence . Each type of the nucleotide blocks the ion flow through the pore for a different period of time . The method does not require modified nucleotides and is performed in real time . Nanopore sequencing is referred to as `` third-generation '' or `` long-read '' sequencing , along with SMRT sequencing ."
"Early industrial research into this method was based on a technique called 'exonuclease sequencing ' , where the readout of electrical signals occurred as nucleotides passed by alpha ( a ) -hemolysin pores covalently bound with cyclodextrin . [ 93 ] However the subsequent commercial method , 'strand sequencing ' , sequenced DNA bases in an intact strand ."
"Two main areas of nanopore sequencing in development are solid state nanopore sequencing , and protein based nanopore sequencing . Protein nanopore sequencing utilizes membrane protein complexes such as a-hemolysin , MspA ( Mycobacterium smegmatis Porin A ) or CssG , which show great promise given their ability to distinguish between individual and groups of nucleotides . [ 94 ] In contrast , solid-state nanopore sequencing utilizes synthetic materials such as silicon nitride and aluminum oxide and it is preferred for its superior mechanical ability and thermal and chemical stability . [ 95 ] The fabrication method is essential for this type of sequencing given that the nanopore array can contain hundreds of pores with diameters smaller than eight nanometers . [ 94 ]"
"The concept originated from the idea that single stranded DNA or RNA molecules can be electrophoretically driven in a strict linear sequence through a biological pore that can be less than eight nanometers , and can be detected given that the molecules release an ionic current while moving through the pore . The pore contains a detection region capable of recognizing different bases , with each base generating various time specific signals corresponding to the sequence of bases as they cross the pore which are then evaluated . [ 95 ] Precise control over the DNA transport through the pore is crucial for success . Various enzymes such as exonucleases and polymerases have been used to moderate this process by positioning them near the pore 's entrance . [ 96 ]"
Short-read sequencing methods

Massively parallel signature sequencing ( MPSS )
"The first of the high-throughput sequencing technologies , massively parallel signature sequencing ( or MPSS ) , was developed in the 1990s at Lynx Therapeutics , a company founded in 1992 by Sydney Brenner and Sam Eletr . MPSS was a bead-based method that used a complex approach of adapter ligation followed by adapter decoding , reading the sequence in increments of four nucleotides . This method made it susceptible to sequence-specific bias or loss of specific sequences . Because the technology was so complex , MPSS was only performed 'in-house ' by Lynx Therapeutics and no DNA sequencing machines were sold to independent laboratories . Lynx Therapeutics merged with Solexa ( later acquired by Illumina ) in 2004 , leading to the development of sequencing-by-synthesis , a simpler approach acquired from Manteia Predictive Medicine , which rendered MPSS obsolete . However , the essential properties of the MPSS output were typical of later high-throughput data types , including hundreds of thousands of short DNA sequences . In the case of MPSS , these were typically used for sequencing cDNA for measurements of gene expression levels . [ 53 ]"
Polony sequencing
Main article : Polony sequencing
"The polony sequencing method , developed in the laboratory of George M. Church at Harvard , was among the first high-throughput sequencing systems and was used to sequence a full E. coli genome in 2005 . [ 97 ] It combined an in vitro paired-tag library with emulsion PCR , an automated microscope , and ligation-based sequencing chemistry to sequence an E. coli genome at an accuracy of > 99.9999 % and a cost approximately 1/9 that of Sanger sequencing . [ 97 ] The technology was licensed to Agencourt Biosciences , subsequently spun out into Agencourt Personal Genomics , and eventually incorporated into the Applied Biosystems SOLiD platform . Applied Biosystems was later acquired by Life Technologies , now part of Thermo Fisher Scientific ."
454 pyrosequencing
Main article : 454 Life Sciences § Technology
"A parallelized version of pyrosequencing was developed by 454 Life Sciences , which has since been acquired by Roche Diagnostics . The method amplifies DNA inside water droplets in an oil solution ( emulsion PCR ) , with each droplet containing a single DNA template attached to a single primer-coated bead that then forms a clonal colony . The sequencing machine contains many picoliter-volume wells each containing a single bead and sequencing enzymes . Pyrosequencing uses luciferase to generate light for detection of the individual nucleotides added to the nascent DNA , and the combined data are used to generate sequence reads . [ 60 ] This technology provides intermediate read length and price per base compared to Sanger sequencing on one end and Solexa and SOLiD on the other . [ 69 ]"
Illumina ( Solexa ) sequencing
Main article : Illumina dye sequencing
"Solexa , now part of Illumina , was founded by Shankar Balasubramanian and David Klenerman in 1998 , and developed a sequencing method based on reversible dye-terminators technology , and engineered polymerases . [ 98 ] The reversible terminated chemistry concept was invented by Bruno Canard and Simon Sarfati at the Pasteur Institute in Paris . [ 99 ] [ 100 ] It was developed internally at Solexa by those named on the relevant patents . In 2004 , Solexa acquired the company Manteia Predictive Medicine in order to gain a massively parallel sequencing technology invented in 1997 by Pascal Mayer and Laurent Farinelli . [ 50 ] It is based on `` DNA clusters '' or `` DNA colonies '' , which involves the clonal amplification of DNA on a surface . The cluster technology was co-acquired with Lynx Therapeutics of California . Solexa Ltd. later merged with Lynx to form Solexa Inc ."
"In this method , DNA molecules and primers are first attached on a slide or flow cell and amplified with polymerase so that local clonal DNA colonies , later coined `` DNA clusters '' , are formed . To determine the sequence , four types of reversible terminator bases ( RT-bases ) are added and non-incorporated nucleotides are washed away . A camera takes images of the fluorescently labeled nucleotides . Then the dye , along with the terminal 3 ' blocker , is chemically removed from the DNA , allowing for the next cycle to begin . Unlike pyrosequencing , the DNA chains are extended one nucleotide at a time and image acquisition can be performed at a delayed moment , allowing for very large arrays of DNA colonies to be captured by sequential images taken from a single camera ."
An Illumina MiSeq sequencer
"Decoupling the enzymatic reaction and the image capture allows for optimal throughput and theoretically unlimited sequencing capacity . With an optimal configuration , the ultimately reachable instrument throughput is thus dictated solely by the analog-to-digital conversion rate of the camera , multiplied by the number of cameras and divided by the number of pixels per DNA colony required for visualizing them optimally ( approximately 10 pixels/colony ) . In 2012 , with cameras operating at more than 10 MHz A/D conversion rates and available optics , fluidics and enzymatics , throughput can be multiples of 1 million nucleotides/second , corresponding roughly to 1 human genome equivalent at 1x coverage per hour per instrument , and 1 human genome re-sequenced ( at approx . 30x ) per day per instrument ( equipped with a single camera ) ."
"This method is an upgraded modification to combinatorial probe anchor ligation technology ( cPAL ) described by Complete Genomics [ 102 ] which has since become part of Chinese genomics company BGI in 2013 . [ 103 ] The two companies have refined the technology to allow for longer read lengths , reaction time reductions and faster time to results . In addition , data are now generated as contiguous full-length reads in the standard FASTQ file format and can be used as-is in most short-read-based bioinformatics analysis pipelines . [ 104 ] [ citation needed ]"
"The two technologies that form the basis for this high-throughput sequencing technology are DNA nanoballs ( DNB ) and patterned arrays for nanoball attachment to a solid surface . [ 102 ] DNA nanoballs are simply formed by denaturing double stranded , adapter ligated libraries and ligating the forward strand only to a splint oligonucleotide to form a ssDNA circle . Faithful copies of the circles containing the DNA insert are produced utilizing Rolling Circle Amplification that generates approximately 300–500 copies . The long strand of ssDNA folds upon itself to produce a three-dimensional nanoball structure that is approximately 220 nm in diameter . Making DNBs replaces the need to generate PCR copies of the library on the flow cell and as such can remove large proportions of duplicate reads , adapter-adapter ligations and PCR induced errors ."
SOLiD sequencing
"DNA nanoball sequencing is a type of high throughput sequencing technology used to determine the entire genomic sequence of an organism . The company Complete Genomics uses this technology to sequence samples submitted by independent researchers . The method uses rolling circle replication to amplify small fragments of genomic DNA into DNA nanoballs . Unchained sequencing by ligation is then used to determine the nucleotide sequence . [ 107 ] This method of DNA sequencing allows large numbers of DNA nanoballs to be sequenced per run and at low reagent costs compared to other high-throughput sequencing platforms . [ 108 ] However , only short sequences of DNA are determined from each DNA nanoball which makes mapping the short reads to a reference genome difficult . [ 107 ] This technology has been used for multiple genome sequencing projects and is scheduled to be used for more ."
There are two main microfluidic systems that are used to sequence DNA ; droplet based microfluidics and digital microfluidics . Microfluidic devices solve many of the current limitations of current sequencing arrays .
"DNA sequencing methods currently under development include reading the sequence as a DNA strand transits through nanopores ( a method that is now commercial but subsequent generations such as solid-state nanopores are still in development ) , [ 118 ] [ 119 ] and microscopy-based techniques , such as atomic force microscopy or transmission electron microscopy that are used to identify the positions of individual nucleotides within long DNA fragments ( > 5,000 bp ) by nucleotide labeling with heavier elements ( e.g. , halogens ) for visual detection and recording . [ 120 ] [ 121 ] Third generation technologies aim to increase throughput and decrease the time to result and cost by eliminating the need for excessive reagents and harnessing the processivity of DNA polymerase ."
Tunnelling currents DNA sequencing
RNAP sequencing
"Microfluidic Sanger sequencing is a lab-on-a-chip application for DNA sequencing , in which the Sanger sequencing steps ( thermal cycling , sample purification , and capillary electrophoresis ) are integrated on a wafer-scale chip using nanoliter-scale sample volumes . This technology generates long and accurate sequence reads , while obviating many of the significant shortcomings of the conventional Sanger method ( e.g . high consumption of expensive reagents , reliance on expensive equipment , personnel-intensive manipulations , etc . ) by integrating and automating the Sanger sequencing steps ."
"A haplotype is a series of linked alleles that are inherited together on a single chromosome . DNA sequencing can be used to genotype all of the single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) that constitute a haplotype . However , short DNA sequencing reads often can not be phased ; that is , heterozygous variants can not be confidently assigned to the correct haplotype . In fact , haplotyping with short read DNA sequencing data requires very high coverage ( average > 50x coverage of each DNA base ) to accurately identify SNPs , as well as additional sequence data from the parents so that Mendelian transmission can be used to estimate the haplotypes . [ 20 ] Sequencing technologies that generate long reads , including transmission electron microscopy DNA sequencing , can capture entire haploblocks in a single read . That is , haplotypes are not broken up among multiple reads , and the genetically linked alleles remain together in the sequencing data . Therefore , long reads make haplotyping easier and more accurate , which is beneficial to the field of population genetics ."
"Genes are normally present in two copies in the diploid human genome ; genes that deviate from this standard copy number are referred to as copy number variants ( CNVs ) . Copy number variation can be benign ( these are usually common variants , called copy number polymorphisms ) or pathogenic . [ 21 ] CNVs are detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) or comparative genomic hybridization ( CGH ) . To detect the specific breakpoints at which a deletion occurs , or to detect genomic lesions introduced by a duplication or amplification event , CGH can be performed using a tiling array ( array CGH ) , or the variant region can be sequenced . Long sequencing reads are especially useful for analyzing duplications or amplifications , as it is possible to analyze the orientation of the amplified segments if they are captured in a single sequencing read ."
"Transmission electron microscopy DNA sequencing is a single-molecule sequencing technology that uses transmission electron microscopy techniques . The method was conceived and developed in the 1960s and 70s , [ 1 ] but lost favor when the extent of damage to the sample was recognized . [ 2 ]"
"In order for DNA to be clearly visualized under an electron microscope , it must be labeled with heavy atoms . In addition , specialized imaging techniques and aberration corrected optics are beneficial for obtaining the resolution required to image the labeled DNA molecule . In theory , transmission electron microscopy DNA sequencing could provide extremely long read lengths , but the issue of electron beam damage may still remain and the technology has not yet been commercially developed ."
"Genome editing , or genome engineering , or gene editing , is a type of genetic engineering in which DNA is inserted , deleted , modified or replaced in the genome of a living organism . Unlike early genetic engineering techniques that randomly inserts genetic material into a host genome , genome editing targets the insertions to site specific locations ."
"Genetic testing , also known as DNA testing , is used to identify changes in DNA sequence or chromosome structure . Genetic testing can also include measuring the results of genetic changes , such as RNA analysis as an output of gene expression , or through biochemical analysis to measure specific protein output . [ 1 ] In a medical setting , genetic testing can be used to diagnose or rule out suspected genetic disorders , predict risks for specific conditions , or gain information that can be used to customize medical treatments based on an individual 's genetic makeup . [ 1 ] Genetic testing can also be used to determine biological relatives , such as a child 's parentage ( genetic mother and father ) through DNA paternity testing , [ 2 ] or be used to broadly predict an individual 's ancestry . [ 3 ] Genetic testing of plants and animals can be used for similar reasons as in humans ( e.g . to assess relatedness/ancestry or predict/diagnose genetic disorders ) , [ 4 ] to gain information used for selective breeding , [ 5 ] or for efforts to boost genetic diversity in endangered populations ."
"Artificial gene synthesis , or gene synthesis , refers to a group of methods that are used in synthetic biology to construct and assemble genes from nucleotides de novo . Unlike DNA synthesis in living cells , artificial gene synthesis does not require template DNA , allowing virtually any DNA sequence to be synthesized in the laboratory . It comprises two main steps , the first of which is solid-phase DNA synthesis , sometimes known as DNA printing . [ 1 ] This produces oligonucleotide fragments that are generally under 200 base pairs . The second step then involves connecting these oligonucleotide fragments using various DNA assembly methods . Because artificial gene synthesis does not require template DNA , it is theoretically possible to make a completely synthetic DNA molecules with no limits on the nucleotide sequence or size ."
"Synthesis of the first complete gene , a yeast tRNA , was demonstrated by Har Gobind Khorana and coworkers in 1972 . [ 2 ] Synthesis of the first peptide- and protein-coding genes was performed in the laboratories of Herbert Boyer and Alexander Markham , respectively . [ 3 ] [ 4 ] More recently , artificial gene synthesis methods have been developed that will allow the assembly of entire chromosomes and genomes . The first synthetic yeast chromosome was synthesised in 2014 , and entire functional bacterial chromosomes have also been synthesised . [ 5 ] In addition , artificial gene synthesis could in the future make use of novel nucleobase pairs ( unnatural base pairs ) ."
"Recombinant DNA are DNA biomolecules that contain genetic sequences that are not native to the organism 's genome . Using recombinant techniques , it is possible to insert , delete , or alter a DNA sequence precisely without depending on the location of restriction sites . Recombinant DNA is used for a wide range of applications ."
"Site-directed mutagenesis is a technique that has been around since the 1970s . The early days of research in this field yielded discoveries about the potential of certain chemicals such as bisulfite and aminopurine to change certain bases in a gene . This research continued , and other processes were developed to create certain nucleotide sequences on a gene , such as the use of restriction enzymes to fragment certain viral strands and use them as primers for bacterial plasmids . The modern method , developed by Michael Smith in 1978 , uses an oligonucleotide that is complementary to a bacterial plasmid with a single base pair mismatch or a series of mismatches ."
"The polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) is a scientific technique that is used to replicate a piece of a DNA molecule by several orders of magnitude . PCR implements a cycle of repeated heated and cooling known as thermal cycling along with the addition of DNA primers and DNA polymerases to selectively replicate the DNA fragment of interest . The technique was developed by Kary Mullis in 1983 while working for the Cetus Corporation . Mullis would go on to win the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1993 as a result of the impact that PCR had in many areas such as DNA cloning , DNA sequencing , and gene analysis ."
"Recombinant DNA ( rDNA ) molecules are DNA molecules formed by laboratory methods of genetic recombination ( such as molecular cloning ) that bring together genetic material from multiple sources , creating sequences that would not otherwise be found in the genome ."
Several novel enabling technologies were critical to the success of synthetic biology . Concepts include standardization of biological parts and hierarchical abstraction to permit using those parts in synthetic systems . [ 38 ] Basic technologies include reading and writing DNA ( sequencing and fabrication ) . Measurements under multiple conditions are needed for accurate modeling and computer-aided design ( CAD ) .

"Synthetic biological circuits are an application of synthetic biology where biological parts inside a cell are designed to perform logical functions mimicking those observed in electronic circuits . The applications range from simply inducing production to adding a measurable element , like GFP , to an existing natural biological circuit , to implementing completely new systems of many parts ."
"In recent years , the emergence of highly versatile genome-editing technologies has provided investigators with the ability to rapidly and economically introduce sequence-specific modifications into the genomes of a broad spectrum of cell types and organisms . The core technologies now most commonly used to facilitate genome editing , shown in Figure 1 , are ( 1 ) clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats ( CRISPR ) -CRISPR-associated protein 9 ( Cas9 ) , ( 2 ) transcription activator-like effector nucleases ( TALENs ) , ( 3 ) zinc-finger nucleases ( ZFNs ) , and ( 4 ) homing endonucleases or meganucleases ."
