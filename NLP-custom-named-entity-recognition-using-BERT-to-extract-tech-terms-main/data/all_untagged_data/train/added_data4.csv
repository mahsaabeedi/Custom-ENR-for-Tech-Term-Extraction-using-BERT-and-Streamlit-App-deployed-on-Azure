"Proposed Deep reinforcement learning algorithms for efficient heating control in smart buildings . Experiments demonstrate that a decentralized control performs better than centralized control for multiple smart buildings.. Therefore , it is necessary to design energy-efficient controllers that can improvise occupant thermal comfort ( deviation from setpoint temperature ) while reducing energy consumption . This research presents a Deep Reinforcement Learning ( DRL ) -based heating controller to improve thermal comfort and minimize energy costs in smart buildings . The results show that the DRL-based smart controller outperforms a traditional thermostat controller by improving thermal comfort between 15 % - 30 % and reducing energy costs between 5 % - 12 % in the simulated environment . We observe that as the number of buildings and differences in their setpoint temperatures increase , decentralized control performs better than a centralized controller .

"To create devices that mimic what occurs in our brain 's neurons and synapses , researchers need to overcome a fundamental molecular engineering challenge : how to design devices that exhibit controllable and energy-efficient transition between different resistive states triggered by incoming stimuli . In a recent study , scientists at the Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering ( PME ) at the University of Chicago were able to predict design rules for such devices . Published November 10 in npj Computational Materials , the study predicted new ways of engineering and triggering changes in electronic properties in several classes of transition metal oxides , which could be used to form the basis of neuromorphic computing architectures . To understand how defects change the state of the material from a metal to an insulator , the authors calculated the electronic structure at different defect concentrations using methods based on quantum mechanics . `` Understanding the intricate interdependency of the charge of these defects , the way atoms rearrange in the material and the way spin properties vary is crucial to controlling and eventually triggering the desired transition , '' said Shenli Zhang , a UChicago postdoctoral researcher and first author of the paper . `` . The study , published by Zhang and Galli , was conducted within the Quantum Materials for Energy Efficient Neuromorphic Computing ( QMEENC ) research center , which is funded by the Department of Energy and led by Prof. `` Understanding quantum materials will provide the key solutions to many scientific and technological problems , including the reduction of energy consumption in computational devices , '' said Schuller .

"MIT scientists have identified a potential new strategy for treating Fragile X syndrome , a disorder that is the leading heritable cause of intellectual disability and autism . In a study of mice , the researchers showed that inhibiting an enzyme called GSK3 alpha reversed many of the behavioral and cellular features of Fragile X . From the mouse studies , there are signs that this compound may not have the same limitations of another class of Fragile X drugs that failed in human clinical trials a few years ago , says Mark Bear , the Picower Professor of Neuroscience , a member of MITs Picower Institute for Learning and Memory , and one of the senior authors of the study . The initial findings in mice suggest that GSK3 alpha inhibitors do not have some of the complications that may have caused the mGluR5 inhibitors to fail in clinical trials , Bear says ."

"By , among other things , preventing new and existing transmission , offshore wind development , oil and natural gas access , and oil and gas pipeline projects all of which are needed to meet basic energy demand and help grow critical supply chain business . Consider that in pushing for the immediate elimination of oil and gas pipeline projects , anti-energy forces nonchalantly forget that renewable energy supplies wont be sufficient to adequately serve and fuel consumers , farmers , businesses and industries for years as our economy recovers . Further , increasing our reliance on renewables will require that we build and develop co-energy sources , such as natural gas , to power our homes when solar and wind resources that depend on certain weather or external conditions beyond our control can not generate . So , this fact needs repeating : The dependability of reliable and reasonable energy supplies rests with regulators and lawmakers as well as an informed citizenry -- recognizing that as we move into recovery , energy is central to our economy and its growth ."

"Now , however , researchers Biswanath Dutta and Poulumi Dey of TU Delft 's department of Materials Science and Engineering , have not only been able to explain how nano-structures in thermoelectric materials can improve energy efficiency , but also propose a commercially attractive way to manufacture nano-structured thermoelectric materials , increasing the chances for mass production of thermoelectric energy . The starting point for Dutta and Dey 's work was the experimental results provided by their co-researchers in South Korea who were working with a well-known thermoelectric material , a so-called NbCoSn half-Heusler compound . But as soon as these nanostructures are formed , you get these interfaces which block the low energy electrons but allow the high energy ones to pass through with the result that the overall energy efficiency is increased . Ultimately , the TU Delft simulations suggested two reasons for increased energy efficiency in this tailored NbCoSn thermoelectric material : the presence of extra cobalt atoms in specific positions called interstitial sites within the lattice structure , and also the energy-filtering effect . Moreover , the improved understanding of why this nano-structured thermoelectric material is more energy-efficient suggests a better , more applicable way to produce thermoelectric energy . `` Currently , nano-structured thermoelectric materials are made through a long and rigorous process of crushing and heating pre-formed structures , '' explains Dutta `` which is both time and energy-consuming , so not ideal for mass production . So it 's more energy efficient and therefore much more useful for mass production of thermoelectric energy .

"Researchers therefore study extraordinary Kerr-type nonlinear materials as a critical element for new passive optical limiters to protect against ultrashort optical pulses . Scientists are yet to report on a material or system that provides a strong enough nonlinearity in the nanoscale in order to facilitate a reflection-mode pulse-limiting effect . detailed a nanoscale Kerr-type optical limiter based on the durable MQW ( metallic quantum wells ) material system to generate femtosecond pulses . The proposed MQW functioned as a dielectric during high-intensity illumination to form a first-in-study reflection-mode optical limiter , providing a new degree of freedom to design an optimal optical limiting system . The nanoscale thin film MQW for a femtosecond pulse limiter worked in the reflection mode and Qian et al . In this way , Haoliang Qian and colleagues demonstrated a nanoscale reflection-mode femtosecond pulse-limiting thin film made of refractory materials for the first time in this study ."
"However , surface effects become dominant as the materials in nanostructured devices become thinner , which means that surface waves may provide the thermal transport solution required . Surface phonon-polaritons ( SPhPs ) - hybrid waves composed of surface electromagnetic waves and optical phonons that propagate along the surfaces of dielectric membraneshave shown particular promise , and a team led by researchers from the Institute of Industrial Science , the University of Tokyo has now demonstrated and verified the thermal conductivity enhancements provided by these waves . The new cooling channel provided by the SPhPs can thus compensate for the reduced phonon thermal conductivity that occurs in nanostructured materials . Y.

"By co-designing the optical elements with computation processing , our proposed display architecture can improve the spatial resolution and angular resolution with a factor of 2 in both horizontal and vertical directions , comparing with these of the conventional light field display with single LCD and standard lens array . First of all , in order to achieve large free space interaction , Chapter 3 proposes vortex ring display as a new dynamic particle control method that improves the depth expression of a particle floating display , presents the engineering challenge and solution to maintain both the stability and visual quality of floating images and discusses potential applications for unobtrusive multisensory AR displays . Recent developments in three-dimensional image display technologies leaded to the growing interest towards spatial perception research aiming to describe the quality of viewing experience , and discover potential benefits and limitations of new visualization approaches . In the experiment , the tabletop light-field display based on aspheric conical lens array can present high quality 360-degree viewable 3D image with the right perception and occlusion . The VC-PDB and the LCM are used to form the super multi-view light field display with low crosstalk , which can provide precisely detectable accommodation depth for human monocular vision . In addition , the proposed method of light field pick-up and reconstruction is implemented to ensure the perceived three dimensional ( 3D ) images with accurate depth cues and correct geometric occlusion , and the eye tracker is used to enlarge the viewing angle of 3D images with smooth motion parallax . To illustrate the capabilities of this technology , we use simple ink masks or a high-resolution commercial liquid-crystal display unit to demonstrate passive and active ( 30 frames per second ) modulation of a 64-view backlight , producing 3D images with a spatial resolution of 88 pixels per inch and full-motion parallax in an unprecedented view zone of 90 degrees ."

"Reversible SuperoxidePeroxide Conversion Realized in K Based High Capacity Rechargeable Battery . There is an urgent need for high energy density rechargeable batteries to further satisfy the evergrowing demand for electrical energy storage devices . However , the practical realization of Li/Na/K O2 battery , a gas open cell architecture , is severely plagued by some gaseous O2 related intrinsic defects . For example , porous air cathode is easily clogged by hosting the solid O2 reduction products , resulting in the practical stored energy reveals far below the theoretical value . , scientists at the Nanjing University in China , and at National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology in Japan present the realization of a reversible superoxide peroxide conversion in a K based high capacity rechargeable sealed battery device . Co authors Yu Qiao and Haoshen Zhou likewise outline the potential development directions and design principle of this reversible superoxide/peroxide ( KO2/K2O2 ) . interconversion on KO2 based cathode system for potassium ion battery ( KIB ) technology . , A novel synergistical modification ideal is abandoning the utilization of gaseous O2 , and controlling the high energydensity oxygen based redox reaction processes within the redox interconversion among different solid phases ( a more commercialized sealed cell environment ) . `` . 2019 , our group successfully trapped the O related redox activity within a reversible peroxide oxide ( Li2O2/Li2O ) interconversion stage ( Nature Catalysis , 2019 , _URL_ . z ) , and achieved a novel high energy density Li ion battery . The most difficult point to realize the reversible superoxide peroxide interconversion focused on the stabilization of superoxide . For the"
"first time , the essential difference between moderate superoxide and dangerous superoxo anion ( O2 ) has been clarified . . On the aspect of `` Battery `` : For the practical battery technology , the development of K ion battery is severely hindered by the limited capacity of cathode candidates ( typically around 100 mAh/g cathode capacity ) . In this work , benefitting from the high capacity KO2/K2O2 redox couple , the cathode capacity has been largely boosted to 300 mAh/g . `` We believe that the demonstration of a superoxide/peroxide redoxdominated battery system with ultralong cycle stability will open up a new gate and spur the development of more effective catalytic cathode frameworks . `` . importantly , the identification of the feasibility ( from the mechanism/chemistry perspective ) and the realization of the impressive cyclability ( from the practical viewpoint ) herein would stimulate the development of oxygen based anionic redox activity in enhancing the energy density of rechargeable battery technologies . `` . `` The desirable features revealed in the current battery system also triggers a design direction for synergistically combining the electrode and electrocatalyst materials , engineering the next generation high energy density battery technologies .

Physics discovery leads to ballistic optical materials . But meshing optics which relies on particles of light called photons with electronics relying on electrons is challenging , due to their disparate scales . The mismatch between electronic systems and optical systems means that every time a signal converts from one to the other , inefficiency creeps into the system . using semiconductors and a novel aspect of physics that amplifies the activity of electrons . Newly developed ballistic optical materials consist of a composite of two transparent materials , creating a plasmonic material . This new class of materials has the potential to dramatically increase the resolution in medical scanning and scientific imaging and drastically reduce the size of supercomputers , creating a future where scientists can see tiny things in far greater detail and devices are smaller and morepowerful . Evgenii Narimanov , a theoretical physicist and professor of electrical and computer engineering at Purdue , explained , `` The most important thing about hyperbolic materials is that they can compress light to almost any scale . But to improve imaging and sensing technologies , scientists need metamaterials that work in the visible on near infrared spectrum , at much shorter wavelengths than the midand far infrared . Narimanov and his collaborators discovered and tested an optical phenomenon called `` ballistic resonance . `` . In these new optical materials , which combine"
"metamaterial concepts with the atomic precision of single crystal semiconductors , free ( ballistic ) electrons interact with an oscillating optical field . Narimanov originated the idea and then teamed up with Kun Li , Andrew Briggs , Seth Bank and Daniel Wasserman at the University of Texas , as well as Evan Simmons and Viktor Podolskiy at the University of Massachusetts Lowell . The University of Texas researchers developed the fabrication technology , while the Massachusetts Lowell scientists contributed to the full quantum theory and performed the numerical simulations to be sure everything functionedas planned .

"Rare earth doped upconversion nanoparticles ( UCNPs ) show great promise in a range of applications , including biological imaging and sensing , solar cells and security inks . Although their emission color can be tuned widely as a function of host matrix and dopant composition , the high dimensionality of the associated parameter space and the sensitivity of emission to these parameters make optimization and precision tuning difficult . Er , Tm UCNPs and a high throughput microfluidic reactor to synthesize and precisely tune the emission characteristics of the particles . We synthesize a range of particles with optimized emission intensity and wide color distribution by changing the doping degree of sensitizer Yb to provide for green orange tunability , and the ratio of TmEr to give greenblue tunability . With the two tunable dimensions , we realize true white light emitting UCNPs based on optimized red , green and blue ( RGB ) emission ratios from a single composition . White lightemitting materials have attracted enormous attention for the development of energy efficient and high performance lighting and displays . Materials of interest include polymers , small molecules , quantum dots and rare earth doped upconversion nanoparticles ( UCNPs ) . Whilst white light emission is relatively easy to achieve by mixing different colors of emitter in a heterogeneous system , such an approach suffers from problems associated with phase separation of the different emitting bodies , unwanted energy transfer , low stability and/or the need for multiple excitation . , which achieved pure white light emission using single source excitation . within a single nanocrystal , and whose emission colors could be tuned by changing the excitation power density for white light . Moreover , bulk reaction approaches to nanocrystal synthesis typically necessitate large investments of time and materials to effectively map an inherently complex reaction parameter space . However , such methods are not suitable for high throughput screening because of difficulties in controlling crosscontamination between solutions runwith different reaction parameter sets . In contrast , droplet based microfluidic reactors have engendered a time efficient high throughput screening approach for some years . . are premixed in one solution , in the proposed high throughput screening method it is imperative that each of the compositional elements can be delivered by a separate syringe to allow fine control of reaction stoichiometry . In this paper , we detail a new synthetic approach for rare earth UCNPs that allows for facile parametric space mapping and fine tuning of RGB emission under NIR excitation . UCNPs , we first develop a novel reaction formulation that enables time efficient screening , where each compositional element can be delivered in a separate precursor for precise tuning of elemental ratios ( in terms of F. . and Na . Second , and to achieve rapid and efficient parameter mapping and product optimization , we show for the first time the use of a high throughput droplet based microfluidic reactor with"
"inline emission analysis for rapid lanthanide doped UCNP synthesis and compositional tuning . Er , Tm nanocrystal composition ( as opposed to a mixed population ) by optimizing elemental ratios , engendering tunable true white light emission based on optimized RGB intensity ratios under single excitation . This significantly improves upon the heat transfer efficiency obtained in flaskbased systems , and reduces reaction times for UCNPs synthesis . Yb , Er , Tm UCNPs by reaction parameter screening , the precursor ratios between each constituent element must be controllable , meaning that each element must to be delivered in a separate precursor . 2 . 2 Parameter optimization and color tuning for NaYF . acts as a sensitizer to absorb the near infrared laser light , whilst Er . Optimization of emission intensity and tuning of spectral profile ( . color ) can be achieved by varying the precursor ratios for the host lattice , sensitizer and activators , along with the reaction temperature . Reactionparameters of different methods for synthesis of NaYF . To achieve higher intensity emission from UCNPs , the activator doping ratio of Er . 3 . After scanning precursor ratios for emission color tuning , we conducted a study of the impact of reaction temperature and residence time , with a view to further optimizing reaction parameters and understanding the influence of these factors on UCNP properties ( . Synthesis of color tunable emission from NaYF . C was sufficient for rapid color tuning of the UCNP emission in our microfluidic reactor . Yb , Er ) benefits the PL intensity , while color can be adjusted by tuning the doping degree of Yb . Moreover , results highlight the powerful capabilities of high throughput microfluidic screening platforms in understanding complex synthetic systems . The blue region ( with peaks at 478 nm and 453 nm ) arises from Tm . To better understand the color evolution , spectra were converted into RGB tristimulus values based on the CIE colour matching functions . In summary , we have developed an entirely new synthesis strategy , in term of reagents , solvent and ligands , for the preparation and facile color tuning of NaYF . By taking advantage of the time and materials efficiency associated with droplet based microfluidic reactors , compositional element ratios ( . Using a guided optimization of reaction parameters , color tunable UCNPs have been synthesized by changing the doping degree of the Yb sensitizer ( allowing controlled greenorange tuning ) and .

"kusadasi escort . antalya escort . Elizabeth Whelan Design Creates an Innovative Fabric Infused with LED Yarn . At Elizabeth Whelan Design in Portland , ME , even fabric has graduated from a decorative backdrop to an intelligent communicative device . The textile design studio recently created its first ever smart textile , LED 2b . a fabric woven with a yarn embedded with LED technology that can send data . Initially installed onto a Morrison panel by Knoll for use in a commercial space , Elizabeth Whelan , founder and principal designer of Elizabeth Whelan Design , is excited about the textiles future capabilities for real world problems . ultimately developed for office privacy panels , but the success of the prototype has sparked further creativity and ingenuity for the integration of LED yarn into a multitude of fabric structures . Once the fabric is woven with the LED yarn , it can be programmed to respond in a variety of ways , and its methods of communication can be read by using an app on a mobile device . . After moving backto Maine around six years ago , after nearly 25 years of living in New York City , Whelan took a look around to see what her new environment offered in terms of design and community . A year later , she came across the Advanced Functional Fabrics of America ( AFFOA ) , a nonprofit institute headquartered near the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) , which led her on the path towards a smart textile . Whelan defines a smart textile as : a fabric integrated with semiconductor technology ."
"The technology can be woven and knitted right into the fabric ( in the form of a smart yarn ) , or applied to a pre existing fabric by methods of printing , stitching and embroidery . Smart textiles elevate the . . After much trial and error , Elizabeth Whelan Design created a fabric that not only was highly functional , but also aesthetically pleasing . The textile studio used reflective and glow in the dark yarns to highlight the evolution of light responsive technology in the yarn . Elizabeth Whelan Designwas given two research and development awards by AFFOA , the first of which was to create a woven fabric using an LED yarn created by Dr. Yoel Fink at MIT . Whelan says the second award was to take this smart fabric and install it into a panel made for commercial spaces . The white yarn , created 10 to 20 years ago , is a photoluminescent yarn , which glows in the dark . Another perk , Whelan notes , is the technology itself can be used as a design element , creating new aesthetically pleasing patterns . s localized messaging capabilities , this fabrics integration into homes , offices , healthcare facilities and other public spaces has the potential to make these interiors safer and more informed .

"High Fidelity Quantum Teleportation Achieved for the First Time . . Immediate Detection of Airborne Viruses Such As COVID 19 With a Disposable Pathogen Monitoring Kit . Critical Temperature for Tropical Tree Lifespan Revealed These Results Are a Warning Sign . A team of researchers has developed a flexible , rechargeable silver oxide zinc battery with a five to 10 times greater areal energy density than state of the art . The battery also is easier to manufacture ; while most flexible batteries need to be manufactured in sterile conditions , under vacuum , this one can be screen printed in normal lab conditions . The areal capacity for this innovative battery is 50 milliamps per square centimeter at room temperature this is 10 20 times greater than the areal capacity of a typical Lithium ion battery . So for the same surface area , the battery described in Joule can provide 5 to 10 times more power . . The new battery has higher capacity than any of the flexible batteries currently available on the market . As the 5G and Internet of Things ( IoT ) market grows rapidly , this battery that outperforms commercial products in high current wireless devices will likely be a main contender as the next generation power source for consumer electronics , said Jonathan Scharf the papers . The printed battery cells were recharged for more than 80 cycles , without showing any major signs of capacity loss . Our core focus was to improve both battery performance and the manufacturing process , said Ying Shirley Meng , director of the UC San Diego Institute for Materials Discovery and"
"Design and one of the papers corresponding authors . To create the battery , the researchers used a proprietary cathode design and chemistry from ZPower . The batterys exceptional energy density is due to its silver oxide zinc , ( AgO Zn ) chemistry . As a result , they usually have limited cycle life and have low capacity . This limits their use to low power , disposable electronics . But ZPowers AgO cathode material relies on a proprietary lead oxide coating to improve AgOs electrochemical stability and conductivity . As anadded benefit , the AgO Zn chemistry is responsible for the batterys low impedance . But AgO had never been used in a screen printed battery before , because it is highly oxidative and chemically degrades quickly . Current collectors , the zinc anode , the AgO cathode and their corresponding separators each constitute a stacked screen printed layer .

"EnergyEfficient Method to Produce Hard Carbon Electrode for Sodium Ion Batteries . The higher capacity of this new hard carbon electrode material means that a 19 % increase in energy density by weight is possible in sodium ion batteries compared with lithiumion batteries . Besides this , rechargeable batteries also serve as crucial components in several eco friendly technologies , like electric systems and cars that harvest renewable energy . in Japan have been trying to overcome this worsening problem by designing rechargeable batteries through alternative and more abundant materials . In a new study , the researchers identified an energyefficient technique to create a new carbon based material specifically for sodium ion batteries . Angewandte Chemie International Edition . The new study targeted the production of hard carbonan extremely porous material that acts as the negative electrode of rechargeable batteriesby using magnesium oxide ( MgO ) as an inorganic template of nano sized pores within the hard carbon . The team investigated another method for combining the ingredients of the MgO template to accurately adjust the nanostructure of the ensuing hard carbon electrode . Following numerous theoretical and experimental studies , the researchers described the optimal manufacturing conditions and ingredients to create hard carbon that has a capacity of 478 mAh/g ; this capacity is the highest to be ever reported in a material of this type . Until now , the capacity of carbon based negative electrode materials for sodium ion batteries was mostly around 300 to 350 mAh/g . This recently designed hard carbon electrode material indeed has an extraordinary capacity , considerably exceeding that of graphite ( 372 mAh/g ) ,"
"which is presently used in lithium ion batteries as the negative electrode material . Furthermore , while a sodium ion battery integrated with this hard carbon negative electrode would theoretically work at a lower voltage difference of 0 . 3 V when compared to a regular lithium ion battery , the higher capacity of the former battery would result in a relatively greater energy density by weight ( that is , 1600 . The hard carbon with extremely high capacity that we developed has opened a door towards the design of newsodium storing materials . . Nevertheless , additional studies will be needed to validate that the recommended material truly provides better inputoutput properties , lifetime and low temperature operation in real sodium ion batteries . If this theory works out , the next generation of rechargeable batteries may soon become a reality . MgO Template Synthesis of Extremely High Capacity Hard Carbon for NaIon Battery . .

"People Still Fax Benefits of Fax . However , contrary to popular belief , fax machines are making a comeback . In fact , 43 million fax machines are in use worldwide , with millions more purchased annually . The fax machine kept up with technological advancement and is now adapted to new solutions . Many companies chose to send and receive faxes over emails . It has plenty of advantages and is commonly used in the health care and financial sectors . You can easily send and receive free taxes to your email or iPhone and turn them into the fax machine . The main advantage of that operation is that it saves you time . It transmits the document instantly only after putting it in a document feeder and entering the number of the receiver . Moreover , although emails work quickly , if you need to attach a large file , uploading it can last longer than sending and receiving faxes . If you start faxing in your company , you can use cloud based fax services that can also send images or PDF files .You can transmit the documents over telephone lines . Of course , with technological advancement , you can also do that via the internet , but its not obligatory . And if theres a network breakdown or your WiFi signal is spotty that day sending a fax is a great solution , especially if its a matter of urgency . Finally , for many office workers , faxing is one of their . , and they cant imagine not using a fax machine . But fax machines are not the hackers target . When you"
"receive an email , you might get an uncertified message or attachment with malware . Even though fax systems can use internet connection now , its still the safest way of communication as it uses a private , secure connection and an individual , unique fax number . As fax machines are more secure and prevent personal data breaches , its common in national health service . Due to the HIPAA compliant fax system , you can be sure that personal privacy is secured , and the number of people who can see the informationis limited if its sent via fax . Online fax services allow their users to have personalized digital signatures , which can be used while sending any confidential file . If you want to sign a document that youve received , you need to print it out , sign , scan , and finally resend it . When it comes to fax servers , you can sign it even without printing the document in the first place . Its a new solution for business owners who want to message their partners and clients safely .

"Hubble Ultra Deep Field : Looking Out Into Space , Looking Back Into Time Video . Physicists Find New State of Matter in a One Dimensional Quantum Gas Beyond My Wildest Conception . A researcher from the Institute of Industrial Science at The University of Tokyo has demonstrated a novel method for recharging sterilized N95 masks so that they can be reused . By exposing the masks to 100 kilovolts for 3 minutes after sterilization in hot water or an autoclave , they regained their static charge . This work can be rapidly applied to help meet the huge demand for protective equipment that can prevent the spread of the COVID virus . During the current COVID pandemic , N95 masks have been indispensable for keeping health care workers and first responders safe . The trick is that the N95 masks are made of electrospun polypropylene fibers , which retain a static electric charge that can attract and trap the charged aerosols . Now , a researcher at The University of Tokyo has shown that sterilized masks can be returned to use after beingrecharged using a van de Graaff generator . These devices , familiar to many science museum visitors , use the friction from a spinning belt to generate very high voltages between two metal conductors . Making use of the high voltage provided by the van de Graaff generator , this method is much faster than alternative methods , study author Kaori Sugihara says . Hopefully , this method will allow many more people to have access to N95 masks each day , which is our best line of defense against COVID transmission"

Christophe Martinez , Yann Lee , Nicolas Clement , Frederic Sermet , and Denis Sarrasin . Light efficient augmented reality 3D display using highly transparent retro reflective screen ( AO ) . Optics Express 3D Image Acquisition and Display : Technology , Perception and Applications ( 2020 ) . We present in details the development of a 360 volumetric display based on the use of a transparent projection surface . Our optical system requires high angular diffusion efficiency and an innovative transparent retroreflective surface has been developed for that purpose . This display based on the use of transparent retro reflective surfaces is described into more details in this paper . To overcome this focus/vergence mismatch , multi view light field displays have been developed thatallow the viewer to focus on the vergence location . This light field display generates 288 images on a 360 horizontal field of view . . The key element for this development is a high angular efficiency transparent projection surface that allows to display bright images . an example of volumetric display based on the use of transparent projection surface . This very simple configuration is based on our transparent retro reflective surface presented in the next sessions . Principle of an aerial display developed in the laboratory based on the use of transparent projection surface and ( b ) visual rendering of the prototype with a cartoon figure projection . The brightness of a display , also referred to the Luminance L , is defined as the amount of visual optical power emitted by units of display surface and viewing solid angle . However , in a classical diffuser scheme , the diffusionangle is applied to the specular reflection of the optical beam incident on the transparent screen . The principle of retro reflection is described in Fig . Two main solutions exist to produce the particular geometrical effect . . In order to use the specific angular directionality and the low cost manufacturing process of this optical element we have proposed recently the development of transparent retro reflective surface based on sparse cube corner retro reflectors . It allows a rapid prototyping and a cost effective production of the CC transparent retro reflective surface . . This good transparency and the limited diffusion angle has shown very efficient behavior for the projection of aerial images as shown before on Fig . Our concept of display leverages the transparent retro reflective effect not directly in a real image configuration as shown in Fig . . Principle of the basic optical module of the volumetric display .The angular design of the display is described in Fig . The center of the exit pupil of the projection system is J0 , J1 is the intersection of one ray with the first mirror that sends light toward the retro reflective surface on the point J3 .

We can see a calibration target projectedon the transparent surface and the virtual retro reflected target seen at a viewing angle about 10 degrees . To measure the brightness of the real projected target image on the transparent retro reflective surface , we replace this surface with a Lambertian diffuser . With the transparent retroreflective surface in place we measure the brightness of the virtual target image for various viewing angles .

"In this study the low cost fused deposition modeling ( FDM ) technique was applied using different thermoplastic printing materials available on the market with focus on flexible filaments such as thermoplastic elastomers ( TPE ) or Soft PLA . Since a good adhesion and stability of the 3D printed structures on textiles are essential , separation force and abrasion resistance tests were conducted with different kinds of printed woven fabrics demonstrating that a sufficient adhesion can be achieved . The main influencing factor can be attributed to the topography of the textile surface affected by the weave , roughness and hairiness offering formlocking connections followed by the wettability of the textile surface by the molten polymer , which depends on the textile surface energy and can be specifically controlled by washing ( desizing ) , finishing or plasma treatment of the textile before the print . Maximum adhesion forces F max of FDM prints ( 350 mm x50 mm ) on different woven fabrics polyester PES , polylactic acid PLA , cotton CO and wool WO . strengths of Soft PLA prints on different unwashed and washed cotton CO and polyester PES fabrics . 343536 Finally , it should be mentioned that some studies report on successful tests to increase the adhesion of the textile fabrics by chemical pre treatments , mostly following the Korger law that more hydrophilic surfaces allow for a better adhesion , . Combining textile fabrics with three dimensional printed items can be a good approach to save time and money as compared with purely three dimensional printed large scale objects , to reach desired position dependent mechanical properties , for design and technological purposes . Here , we give an overview of the recent state of experimental research on adhesion in textile/polymer composites as well as of theoretical investigations on adhesion inside the three dimensional printed part . Besides these parameters , chemical and physical surface treatments of the textile fabric before printing and the composite afterwards were investigated . While it enables producing new structures and makes individualized products affordable , 3D printed objects still suffer from low production speed and often insufficient mechanical properties . The washing process significantly decreased the initial adhesion strength of 3D printed material and therefore , a pretreatment such as plasma , corona or chemical finishing are advised to be applied to guarantee better washing resistance and adhesion properties 79 by enhancing intermolecular interactions like hydrogen bonding or dipole dipole interaction between the molecules of the polymer and the textile surface before the print 75 , . The combination of textiles and three dimensional printing offers a wide range of research and application areas , but only publications in combination with fused deposition modeling processes can be found so far . Research has been done to improve the mechanical properties of fabrics , whilemaintaining the drape and functionality of the textiles by direct deposition of polymers onto textile fabrics using 3D printing techniques . The use of statistical techniques to study the machine parameters affecting the properties of 3D printed cotton/polylactic acid fabrics . Textile materials have been combined with polymers using 3D printing technology ,"
"thus producing structures with novel properties . The aim of this study was to use statistical methods to determine the effect of 3D printing machine parameters on the mechanical properties of cotton fabrics combined with polylactic acid . . Testing thermoplastic elastomers selected as flexible three dimensional printing materials for functional garment and technical textile applications . Three dimensional printing has already been shown to be beneficial to the fabrication of custom fit and functional products in different industry sectors such as orthopaedics , implantology and dental technology . In this article , different flexible thermoplastic elastomers , namely , thermoplastic polyurethanes and thermoplastic styrene blockcopolymers with a Shore hardness range of 67A86A are tested as suitable printing materials by means of extrusion based fused deposition modelling . For this , adhesion force , abrasion and wash resistance tests are conducted using various knitted and woven workwear and sportswear fabrics primarily made of cotton , polyester or aramid as textile substrates . 24 pointed out the importance of chemical factors in the adhesion , showing that PLA is the ideal printing material , while polywool , cotton , and soy fabrics were the best substrates . started modifying the fiber surface by washing and plasma treatment of different substrates , resulting in the Korger law that more hydrophilic fabrics showed better adhesion . Improving adhesion of three dimensional printed objects on textile fabrics by polymer coating . Three dimensional printing on textile fabrics , for example , allows for creating large areas with sufficient lateral mechanical properties in a reasonable time on which threedimensional printed parts give additional functionalities or laterally selective mechanical rigidity and so on . To create three dimensional printed personalized knee joint support bandages , however , the adhesion between textile fabric and polymeric parts needs to be further increased . Here , we report on the influence of a polymer coating on different textile fabrics on the adhesion of three dimensional printed elements from hard and soft poly ( lactic acid ) . Combining 3D printed forms with textile structures Mechanical and geometrical properties of multi material systems . The main challenge results from the insufficient mechanical properties , especially the low tensile strength , of pure 3D printed products , prohibiting them from replacing common technologies such as weaving or knitting . Thus , one way to the application of 3D printed forms in garments is combining them with textile fabrics , the latter ensuring the necessary tensile strength . This article reports about different approaches tocombine 3D printed polymers with different textile materials and fabrics , showing chances and limits of this technique . The purpose of this paper is to investigate the adhesion of polymer materials printed directly onto fabrics using entry level fused deposition modelling ( FDM ) machines . Among the three polymers , PLA showed the best results when printed on the eight different types of fabrics , having extremely good adhesion with little warp , yet displaying a high quality of print with good flexural strength . Originality/value This paper has contributed to new knowledge by providing a better understanding of polymer materials being printed directly"
"onto fabrics using entry level FDM machines . Combining 3D printed objects with textile or fibrous materials , however , often results in low adhesion forces between both parts and therefore delamination of layers of different materials . The Fused Deposition Modelling ( FDM ) printing technology , which is one of themain additive manufacture technologies , is widely used in many fields with multiple materials . Especially 3D printing using FDM ( fused deposition modeling ) technology has become affordable for everyone and enables adding novel functionalities on textile fabrics , changing the original mechanical or other properties . adhesion between both textile substrates and FDM printed thermoplasts , in a new project we tested the possibilities to deform textile fabrics by imprinted lamellae which are oriented approximately perpendicular to the surface and on the other hand to deform such lamellae by mechanically influencing the textile fabric . This article will give an overview of the interaction between textile fabrics and imprinted lamellae , depending on textile and 3D print parameters , and depict possible applications in design and technology . 3D printing , also known as additive manufacturing ( AM ) , offers new ways of textile surface modification or functionalization using fused deposition modelling technology ( FDM ) . In this paper , the adhesion strengths of the thermoplastic Soft PLA printed on different textile surfaces were tested , which included the adaptation of an existing testing method with respect to separation force measurements . In this context , in addition to 3D printer settings and different combinations of Soft PLA and textile materials , the influences of textile physical and chemical surface properties such as weaves , surface roughness and after plasma treatment or washing were investigated . These results can serve as a valuable basis for the application of 3D elements on textiles with improved and added functionalities like antistatic or conductive paths or plugs using adequate printing materials to be developed in the future . Mechanical properties of composites from textiles and 3D printed materials . 3D printing is a quite new additive manufacturing process , allowing to create novel shapes or to add functionalities to other objects , such as textile fabrics . Especiallywith the FDM ( fused deposition modelling ) technology , multi material items can be created by printing on existing objects or including other materials during the printing process . The chapter shows possibilities to include textile materials into 3D printed objects , created from diverse polymers , and discusses the influence of physical and chemical modifications of both materials surfaces . It shows how the interface adhesion changes the mechanical properties of the composites from textile materials and one or more 3D printed polymers . In the current paper , the development of constructive and manufacturing technology solutions for intelligent combination and processing of innovative material systems and thermoplastic fiber reinforced plastics for hybrid sandwich elements was realized . The combination of 3D printing and textile surfaces is important for the development of new products and manufacturing processes . This work documents the essential research results of the investigations of combinations of additive manufacturing with textile products ."

"Smart textiles research represents a new model for generating creative and novel solutions for integrating electronics into unusual environments and will result in new discoveries that push the boundaries of science forward . A key driver for smart textiles research is the fact that both textile and electronics fabrication processes are capable of functionalizing large area surfaces at very high speeds . We then proceed to discuss fundamentals of smart textiles : textile fabrication methods and textile interconnect lines , textile sensor , and output device components and integration of commercial components into textile architectures . E textiles are clothes embedded with microcomputers , digital components ( sensor , LED ) , and other electronic devices . Therefore , fabrication of environmental friendly materials functioning as health monitoring systems and EMR absorbers in a wide bandwidth , produced at lowcosts and exhibiting design flexibility , became a stringent necessity nowadays . As a result , many research papers are aimed at investigating smart materials for various specific tasks such as measuring temperature and blood pressure 10 , monitoring the pH level of wounds and burns 11 , drug delivery 12 , electrical stimulation of muscles and posture correction 13 , monitoring vital functions for geriatric or disabled patients . An important class of smartmaterials is represented by magneto active fabrics ( MAFs ) , since they can be designed to include crucial features that enable fabrication of high performance health monitoring systems and EMR absorbers 20 . Research literatures are replete with examples of electrical conductors in the form of printed inks , conductive threads , thin film metals , and etched copper films that have been implemented on textiles for interconnecting surface mount electronic components and , in some cases , for fabricating the electronics themselves on the fabric 1 , . To improve the durability of these filaments , this paper uses the classical beam theory to investigate the material characteristics ( thickness and elastic modulus ) and suitability of different encapsulations such as polyimide , polyurethane , mylar , and PEEK films for limiting the mechanical stress on the electrical conductors ."
"A smart textile technology has been spotlighted due to their tremendous possibilities in wearable electronics application including sensors , displays and computing devices . Owing to the conformability of textiles , fiber sensors embedded in textiles have been developed as communication interfaces between the human and its environment . . Electrical Percolation to optimize the Electromechanical Properties of CNT/Polymer Composites in Highly Stretchable Fiber Strain Sensors . In order to compareour model with experimental results , two CNT/polymer composite fibers were fabricated and tested as strain sensors . The results confirm that the proposed simulation model reproduces well the experimental data and is useful for predicting and optimizing the electromechanical characteristics of highly stretchable fiber strain sensors based on CNT/polymer composites . Most smart textiles presently on the market are either at the stage adaption or integration or at an intermediate stage where some components are detachable and others , most often conductor tracks and sensors , are firmly integrated and non removable . In this article , the effect of textile substrates and washing factors time , temperature and mechanical action on the reliability of conductor tracks is researched . The effects of different washing conditions on different combinations of textile substrate and conductor tracks were determined via changes in conductivity . Instead , washability is influenced by the choice and combination of materials as well as methods of integration and processing important to consider when developing new products . Smart fabrics can be defined as fabrics that are manufactured and modified to sense and transfer different external or environmental which can be chemical , mechanical , magnetic , thermal , electrical , optical , etc 1 , . For example , incontexts that use smart textiles or e textiles , wearable sensors are embedded in clothing items that take on many diverse shapes and forms . Directly printing conductive ink on textiles is simple and compatible with the conventional electronics manufacturing process . Achieving conductive patterns with low initial resistance and reduced deformation induced resistance increase is a significant challenge in the field of electronic textiles ( e textiles ) . This feld"

It is possible to integrate flexible electronics , optical devices and sensors into textiles . The evolution of electronics and textile technologies have enabled the combination of their strengths , increasing computing speed , reducing chip size , improving energy autonomies and offering flexible surfaces . . Textiles offer properties that are suitable to be used as holders for electronics or sensors components . Many sensing technologies have been explored considering textiles substrates in combination with conductive materials in the last years . F lexible electronics and particularly soft fibers and functional textiles are becoming an ideal platform in the areas of biomedical and health monitoring , implants and prosthesis , motion tracking , artificial intelligence , and human machine interaction . Fibers that harvestmechanical energy via the triboelectric effect are excellent candidates as power sources for wearable electronics and functional textiles . In addition to energy harvesting , we demonstrate self powered breathing monitoring and gesture sensing capabilities , making this triboelectric fiber platform an exciting avenue for multi functional wearable systems and smart textiles . Therefore , most of the wearable baby monitoring technology is either in the form of wearable devices or smart clothing while both of these products can be wirelessly connected to smartphones . Technological breakthroughs in the field of physical biosensors and electronics integrate into textile materials and their applications in monitoring human vital signs such as heart rate , oxygen level , blood pressure , body temperature , and respiratory rate have discussed . We examine environmental sustainability issues through a review of recent research and cases across three broad areas including the fashion industry , information and communications technology ( ICT ) , and wearable technologies . By combining traditional textiles and new fabrication technologies , we can achieve new functionalities . Both strategies are contributing to develop innovative products for energy storage , drug release , biosensor , functional electronic clothes , medical implants , and armor for ballistic protection . Printed sensors have been explored for morethan two"

COVID 19 is proving to be an unprecedented disaster for human health , social contacts , and the economy worldwide . Under the stress placed by the current pandemic on the sanitary performance across all MSW management ( MSWM ) chains , this industry needs to re examine its infrastructure resilience with respect to all processes , from waste identification , classification , collection , separation , storage , transportation , recycling , treatment , and disposal . The current paper provides an overview of the severe challenges placed by COVID 19 onto MSW systems , highlighting"
"theessential role of waste management in the protection of public health during the ongoing pandemic . It also discusses the measures issued by various countries for protection of MSWM employees ( MSWE ) , identifying the gaps , especially in developing countries , where personal protection equipment ( PPE ) and clear guidelines to MSWE may not have been provided , and the general public may not be well informed . In developed countries with high recycling rates of MSW , the need to protect MSWEs health has affected the supply stream of the recycling industry . Impact of COVID 19 pandemic on waste management . The containment of the spread of COVID 19 pandemic and limitations on commercial activities , mobility and manufacturing sector have significantly affected waste management . Waste management is critical to human development and health outcomes , especially during the COVID 19 pandemic . The invaluable service provided by the waste management sector ensures that the unusual heaps of waste that poses health risks and escalate the spread of COVID 19 is avoided . In this study , we assess the impact of COVID 19 pandemic on waste management by observing lockdown and social distancing measures . Increased plastic pollution due to COVID 19 pandemic : Challenges and recommendations . Digital technologies in the public health response to COVID 19 .

"monitor skin temperature , respiratory rate , blood pressure , pulse rate , blood oxygen saturation and daily activities . Continuous on body sensing for the COVID 19 pandemic : . Performance of fabrics for home made masks against the spread of COVID 19 through droplets : . Coronavirus Disease 2019 ( COVID 19 ) may spread through respiratory droplets released by infected individuals during coughing , sneezing , or speaking . Given the limited supply of professional respirators and face masks , the U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) has recommended home made cloth face coverings foruse by the general public . Here , we ascertained the performance of 11 common household fabrics at blocking large , high velocity droplets , using a commercial medical mask as a benchmark . In particular , two layers of highly permeable fabric , such as T shirt cloth , blocks droplets with an efficiency ( 94 % ) similar to that of medical masks , while being approximately twice as breathable . Overall , our study suggests that cloth face coverings , especially with multiple layers , may help reduce droplet transmission of respiratory infections . Furthermore , face coverings made from materials such as cotton fabrics allow washing and reusing , and can help reduce the adverse environmental effects of widespread use of commercial disposable and nonbiodegradable facemasks . Surface innovation to enhance anti droplet and hydrophobic behavior of breathable compressed polyurethane masks . With the emergence of the coronavirus disease ( COVID 19 ) , it is essential that face masks demonstrating significant anti droplet and hydrophobic characteristics are developed and distributed . Moreover , the coating had negligible effect on the average pore size of the C PU mask , which retained its high breathability after modification . The application of this coating is a facile approach to impart anti droplet , hydrophobic , and self cleaning characteristics to C PU masks . Challenges and strategies for effective plastic waste management during and post COVID 19 pandemic . The advent of the COVID 19 pandemic has enhanced the complexities of plastic waste management . Our improved , hyper hygienic way of life in the fear of transmission has conveniently shifted our behavioral patterns like the use of PPE ( Personal protective equipment ) , increased demand for plastic packaged food and groceries , and the use of disposable utensils . Mandating scientific sterilizationand the use of sealed bags for safe disposal of contaminated plastic wastes should be an immediate priority to reduce the risk of transmission to sanitation workers . Transition towards environmentally friendly materials like bioplastics and harboring new sustainable technologies would be crucial to fighting future pandemics . The Escalating Biomedical Waste Management To Control the Environmental Transmission of COVID 19 . The global pandemic COVID 19 culminated in escalating biomedical waste ( BMW ) worldwide , and the management authorities are struggling with waste treatment . population might sum up to a large amount of COVID 19 related BMW . Here ,"
"we have shown a framework leading to further environmental and community transmission of the COVID 19 pandemic if the BMW generated at healthcare facilities and homes is not appropriately managed . The BMW , such as safety suits or personal protective equipment ( PPE ) , masks , gloves , and shields , would likely damage the environment in the long run by creating microplastic pollution . Moreover , occupational health and safety assessments for waste management workers at the hospitals are recommended . This pandemic has put unprecedented pressure on global healthcare systems , with personal protective equipment ( PPE ) being the most notable one . challenge of procurement of PPE , the major challenge is rationalizing the use of PPE in this war against corona virus disease 19 ( COVID19 ) . Making PPE user friendly and limiting the interaction of HCW with COVID19 patients coupled with the use of robotics , telemedicine , and other innovations is the need of the hour . Graphene nanoplatelet and Graphene oxide functionalization of face mask materials inhibits infectivi . provides an opportunity to develop engineered textiles for use in PPE . The face masks widely used in health care and other high risk settingsfor COVID transmission provide only a physical barrier that decreases likelihood of infection and do not inactivate the virus . The findings presented here constitute an important nanomaterials based strategy to significantly increase face mask and other PPE efficacy in protection against the SARS CoV 2 virus and COVID 19 that may be applicable to additional anti SARS CoV 2 measures including water filtration , air purification , and diagnostics . Journal Pre proof COVID 19 pandemic repercussions on plastic and antiviral polymeric textile causing . The propagation of the COVID 19 pandemic worldwide has been alarming in the last months . According to recommendations of the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , the use of face masks is essential for slowing down the transmission rate of COVID 19 in human beings . This pandemic has generated a substantial increase in the use , as well as in the production , of face masks and other elements ( gloves , . face protectors , protective suits , safety shoes ) manufactured with polymeric materials , including antiviral textiles most of which will end as microplastic pools . Focusing on South America , the use and mismanagement of this type of personal protective equipment ( PPE ) represents an environmental problem . Recently , researchers have developed antiviral polymeric textile technology composed of Ag and Cu nanoparticles for PPE to reduce the contagion and spread of COVID 19 . For this reason , this work provides reflections and perspectives on how the COVID 19 pandemic can aggravate plastic pollution on beaches and coastal environments , consequently increasing the damage to marine species in the coming years . In addition , the potential impact of the pandemic on waste management systems is discussed here , as well as future research directions to improve integrated coastal management strategies ."
