"An aircraft is a vehicle that is able to fly by gaining support from the air . It counters the force of gravity by using either static lift or by using the dynamic lift of an airfoil , [ 2 ] or in a few cases the downward thrust from jet engines . Common examples of aircraft include airplanes , helicopters , airships ( including blimps ) , gliders , paramotors and hot air balloons ."
"An unmanned aerial vehicle ( UAV ) ( or uncrewed aerial vehicle , [ 2 ] commonly known as a drone ) is an aircraft without a human pilot on board . UAVs are a component of an unmanned aircraft system ( UAS ) , which include a UAV , a ground-based controller , and a system of communications between the two . [ 3 ] [ 4 ] The flight of UAVs may operate with various degrees of autonomy : either under remote control by a human operator or autonomously by onboard computers [ 5 ] referred to as an autopilot ."
"One way to achieve autonomous control employs multiple control-loop layers , as in hierarchical control systems . As of 2016 the low-layer loops ( i.e . for flight control ) tick as fast as 32,000 times per second , while higher-level loops may cycle once per second . The principle is to decompose the aircraft 's behavior into manageable `` chunks '' , or states , with known transitions . Hierarchical control system types range from simple scripts to finite state machines , behavior trees and hierarchical task planners . The most common control mechanism used in these layers is the PID controller which can be used to achieve hover for a quadcopter by using data from the IMU to calculate precise inputs for the electronic speed controllers and motors ."
"In computational geometry and robotics , simultaneous localization and mapping ( SLAM ) is the computational problem of constructing or updating a map of an unknown environment while simultaneously keeping track of an agent 's location within it . While this initially appears to be a chicken-and-egg problem there are several algorithms known for solving it , at least approximately , in tractable time for certain environments . Popular approximate solution methods include the particle filter , extended Kalman filter , Covariance intersection , and GraphSLAM . SLAM algorithms are used in navigation , robotic mapping and odometry for virtual reality or augmented reality ."
"SLAM algorithms are tailored to the available resources , hence not aimed at perfection , but at operational compliance . Published approaches are employed in self-driving cars , unmanned aerial vehicles , autonomous underwater vehicles , planetary rovers , newer domestic robots and even inside the human body ."
"A micro air vehicle ( MAV ) , or micro aerial vehicle , is a class of miniature UAVs that has a size restriction and may be autonomous . Modern craft can be as small as 5 centimeters . Development is driven by commercial , research , government , and military purposes ; with insect-sized aircraft reportedly expected in the future . The small craft allows remote observation of hazardous environments inaccessible to ground vehicles . MAVs have been built for hobby purposes , [ 2 ] such as aerial robotics contests and aerial photography ."
