"Airless tires , non-pneumatic tires ( NPT ) , or flat-free tires are tires that are not supported by air pressure . They are used on some small vehicles such as riding lawn mowers and motorized golf carts . They are also used on heavy equipment such as backhoes , which are required to operate on sites such as building demolition , where risk of tire punctures is high . Tires composed of closed-cell polyurethane foam are also made for bicycles and wheelchairs . They are also commonly found on wheelbarrows which may be used for yard work or construction ."
"An alternative fuel vehicle is a motor vehicle that runs on alternative fuel , an energy other than traditional petroleum fuels ( petrol or Diesel fuel ) ; and also refers to any technology of powering an engine that does not involve solely petroleum ( e.g . electric car , hybrid electric vehicles , solar powered ) . Because of a combination of factors , such as environmental concerns , high oil prices and the potential for peak oil , development of cleaner alternative fuels and advanced power systems for vehicles has become a high priority for many governments and vehicle manufacturers around the world ."

"Autonomous Rail Rapid Transit is a railless guided bus system for urban passenger transport . Developed by CRRC Zhuzhou Institute Co Ltd , it was unveiled in Zhuzhou in Hunan province on 2 June 2017 . [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 11 ]"
"The product has been described as a crossover between a train , a bus and a tram . [ 12 ] Its external appearance , composed of individual , fixed sections joined together by articulated gangways , resembles a rubber-tyred tram , although it has the flexibility to move around like a normal articulated bus or trackless train ."
"Beam-powered propulsion , also known as directed energy propulsion , is a class of aircraft or spacecraft propulsion that uses energy beamed to the spacecraft from a remote power plant to provide energy . The beam is typically either a microwave or a laser beam and it is either pulsed or continuous . A continuous beam lends itself to thermal rockets , photonic thrusters and light sails , whereas a pulsed beam lends itself to ablative thrusters and pulse detonation engines . [ 1 ]"
The rule of thumb that is usually quoted is that it takes a megawatt of power beamed to a vehicle per kg of payload while it is being accelerated to permit it to reach low earth orbit .
"A self-driving car , also known as an autonomous vehicle ( AV or auto ) , driverless car , or robo-car [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] is a vehicle that is capable of sensing its environment and moving safely with little or no human input . [ 4 ] [ 5 ]"
"Self-driving cars combine a variety of sensors to perceive their surroundings , such as radar , lidar , sonar , GPS , odometry and inertial measurement units . [ 1 ] [ 4 ] Advanced control systems interpret sensory information to identify appropriate navigation paths , as well as obstacles and relevant signage ."
"An ion-propelled aircraft or , shortened ionocraft , is an aircraft that uses electrohydrodynamics ( EHD ) to provide lift or thrust in the air without requiring combustion or moving parts . Current designs do not produce sufficient thrust for manned flight or useful loads ."
An adaptive compliant wing is a wing which is flexible enough for aspects of its shape to be changed in flight .
"Fluidics , or fluidic logic , is the use of a fluid to perform analog or digital operations similar to those performed with electronics ."
"The physical basis of fluidics is pneumatics and hydraulics , based on the theoretical foundation of fluid dynamics . The term fluidics is normally used when devices have no moving parts , so ordinary hydraulic components such as hydraulic cylinders and spool valves are not considered or referred to as fluidic devices ."
"A jet of fluid can be deflected by a weaker jet striking it at the side . This provides nonlinear amplification , similar to the transistor used in electronic digital logic . It is used mostly in environments where electronic digital logic would be unreliable , as in systems exposed to high levels of electromagnetic interference or ionizing radiation ."
A flying car is a type of personal air vehicle or roadable aircraft that provides door-to-door transportation by both ground and air . The term `` flying car '' is also sometimes used to include hovercars .
"Many prototypes have been built since the early 20th century , using a variety of flight technologies , such as distributed propulsion ; some have true VTOL performance . The PAL-V Liberty roadable aircraft targeted 2021 to become the first flying car in full production ."
"A fusion rocket is a theoretical design for a rocket driven by fusion propulsion which could provide efficient and long-term acceleration in space without the need to carry a large fuel supply . The design relies on the development of fusion power technology beyond current capabilities , and the construction of rockets much larger and more complex than any current spacecraft . A smaller and lighter fusion reactor might be possible in the future when more sophisticated methods have been devised to control magnetic confinement and prevent plasma instabilities . Inertial fusion could provide a lighter and more compact alternative , as might a fusion engine [ 1 ] based on a field-reversed configuration . Fusion nuclear pulse propulsion is one approach to using nuclear fusion energy to provide propulsion for rockets ."
"A hoverbike ( or hovercycle ) is a vehicle that can hover , but that otherwise resembles a motorbike , mainly by having at least two propulsive portions—one in front of and one behind the driver ."
"A hovertrain is a type of high-speed train that replaces conventional steel wheels with hovercraft lift pads , and the conventional railway bed with a paved road-like surface , known as the track or guideway . The concept aims to eliminate rolling resistance and allow very high performance , while also simplifying the infrastructure needed to lay new lines ."
"Hovertrain is a generic term , and the vehicles are more commonly referred to by their project names where they were developed . In the UK they are known as tracked hovercraft , in the US they are tracked air-cushion vehicles . The hovertrain was originally developed by Jean Bertin ( 1917-1975 ) in France , where they were marketed as the Aérotrain ( 1965-1977 ) , before it was eventually abandoned by the French government ."
"A ground effect train is an alternative to a magnetic levitation ( maglev ) train . In both cases the objective is to prevent the vehicle from making contact with the ground . Whereas a maglev train accomplishes this through the use of magnetism , a ground effect train uses an air cushion ; either in the manner of a hovercraft ( as in hovertrains ) [ citation needed ] or using the `` wing-in-ground '' design ."
"High-altitude platform station or High-Altitude Pseudo-Satellite ( short : HAPS ) or High-Altitude Platform ( short : HAP or HAPs [ plural ] ) is – according to Article 1.66A of the International Telecommunication Union 's ( ITU ) ITU Radio Regulations ( RR ) [ 33 ] – defined as `` a station on an object at an altitude of 20 to 50 km and at a specified , nominal , fixed point relative to the Earth '' ."
"A jet pack , rocket belt , or rocket pack is a device worn on the back which uses jets of gas or liquid to propel the wearer through the air . The concept has been present in science fiction for almost a century and became widespread in the 1960s . Real jet packs have been developed using a variety of mechanisms , but their uses are much more limited than their fictional counterparts because of the challenges of the Earth 's atmosphere , gravity , the low energy density of utilisable fuels , and the human body not being suited to flight , and they are principally used for stunts . A practical use for the jet pack has been in extra-vehicular activities for astronauts because of the apparent weightlessness and lack of friction-creating atmosphere in orbit . The term jet suit is used for a system incorporating a jet pack and associated jets attached to the arms to increase manoeuvrability"
"A backpack helicopter is a helicopter motor and rotor and controls assembly that can be strapped to a person 's back , so they can walk about on the ground wearing it , and can use it to fly . It uses a harness like a parachute harness and should have a strap between the legs ( so the pilot does not fall out of the harness during flight ) . Some designs may use a ducted fan design to increase upward thrust . Several inventors have tried to make backpack helicopters , with mixed results ."
"A vactrain ( or vacuum tube train ) is a proposed design for very-high-speed rail transportation . It is a maglev ( magnetic levitation ) line using partly evacuated tubes or tunnels . Reduced air resistance could permit vactrains to travel at very high ( hypersonic ) speeds with relatively little power—up to 6,400–8,000 km/h ( 4,000–5,000 mph ) . This is 5–6 times the speed of sound in Earth 's atmosphere at sea level ."
Magnetic levitation ( maglev ) or magnetic suspension is a method by which an object is suspended with no support other than magnetic fields . Magnetic force is used to counteract the effects of the gravitational acceleration and any other accelerations .
"Magnetic levitation is used for maglev trains , contactless melting , magnetic bearings and for product display purposes ."
"A mass driver or electromagnetic catapult is a proposed method of non-rocket spacelaunch which would use a linear motor to accelerate and catapult payloads up to high speeds . All existing and contemplated mass drivers use coils of wire energized by electricity to make electromagnets . Sequential firing of a row of electromagnets accelerates the payload along a path . After leaving the path , the payload continues to move due to momentum ."
Miniaturized mass drivers can also be used as weapons in a similar manner as classic firearms or cannon using chemical combustion . Hybrids between coilguns and railguns such as helical railguns are also possible .
"In a traditional nuclear photonic rocket , an onboard nuclear reactor would generate such high temperatures that the blackbody radiation from the reactor would provide significant thrust . The disadvantage is that it takes much power to generate a small amount of thrust this way , so acceleration is very low . The photon radiators would most likely be constructed using graphite or tungsten . Photonic rockets are technologically feasible , but rather impractical with current technology based on an onboard nuclear power source . However , the recent development of Photonic Laser Thruster ( PLT ) , the Beamed Laser Propulsion ( BLP ) with photon recycling , promises to overcome these issues by separating the nuclear power source and the spacecraft and by increasing the thrust to nuclear power ratio ( specific thrust ) by orders of magnitude ."
"Personal rapid transit ( PRT ) , also referred to as podcars or guided/railed taxis , is a public transport mode featuring small automated vehicles operating on a network of specially built guideways . PRT is a type of automated guideway transit ( AGT ) , a class of system which also includes larger vehicles all the way to small subway systems . In terms of routing , it tends towards personal public transport systems ."
"A photon rocket is a rocket that uses thrust from the momentum of emitted photons ( radiation pressure by emission ) for its propulsion . [ 1 ] Photon rockets have been discussed as a propulsion system that could make interstellar flight possible , which requires [ citation needed ] the ability to propel spacecraft to speeds at least 10 % of the speed of light , v~0.1c = 30,000 km/sec ( Tsander , 1967 ) . Photon propulsion has been considered to be one of the best available interstellar propulsion concepts , because it is founded on established physics and technologies ( Forward , 1984 ) ."
"The limitations posed by the rocket equation can be overcome , as long as the reaction mass is not carried by the spacecraft . In the Beamed Laser Propulsion ( BLP ) , the photon generators and the spacecraft are physically separated and the photons are beamed from the photon source to the spacecraft using lasers ."
"In transportation , the Physical Internet® refers to the combination of digital transportation networks that are deploying to replace analog road networks . As the Internet has resolved itself into niche implementations for high-speed ( fiberoptics ) , local area networks ( Wifi ) , and local device ( BlueTooth ) . ET3 and Hyperloop are currently high speed examples . JPods are examples of urban networks ."
"A scooter-sharing system is a service in which electric motorized scooters ( also referred to as e-scooters ) are made available to use for short-term rentals . E-scooters are typically `` dockless '' , meaning that they do not have a fixed home location and are dropped off and picked up from certain locations in the service area ."
"An orbital propellant depot is a cache of propellant that is placed in orbit around Earth or another body to allow spacecraft or the transfer stage of the spacecraft to be fueled in space . It is one of the types of space resource depots that have been proposed for enabling infrastructure-based space exploration . [ 1 ] Many different depot concepts exist depending on the type of fuel to be supplied , location , or type of depot which may also include a propellant tanker that delivers a single load to a spacecraft at a specified orbital location and then departs . In-space fuel depots are not necessarily located near or at a space station ."
"A pulse detonation engine ( PDE ) is a type of propulsion system that uses detonation waves to combust the fuel and oxidizer mixture . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] The engine is pulsed because the mixture must be renewed in the combustion chamber between each detonation wave and the next . Theoretically , a PDE can operate from subsonic up to a hypersonic flight speed of roughly Mach 5 . An ideal PDE design can have a thermodynamic efficiency higher than other designs like turbojets and turbofans because a detonation wave rapidly compresses the mixture and adds heat at constant volume . Consequently , moving parts like compressor spools are not necessarily required in the engine , which could significantly reduce overall weight and cost . PDEs have been considered for propulsion since 1940 . [ 3 ] Key issues for further development include fast and efficient mixing of the fuel and oxidizer , the prevention of autoignition , and integration with an inlet and nozzle ."
"A space elevator is a proposed type of planet-to-space transportation system . [ 1 ] The main component would be a cable ( also called a tether ) anchored to the surface and extending into space . The design would permit vehicles to travel along the cable from a planetary surface , such as the Earth 's , directly into space or orbit , without the use of large rockets ."
"A spaceplane is a vehicle that can fly/glide like an aircraft in Earth 's atmosphere and maneuver like a spacecraft in outer space . [ 1 ] To do so , spaceplanes must incorporate features of both aircraft and spacecraft , occupying an intermediate space between the two . Orbital spaceplanes are more like spacecraft , while sub-orbital spaceplanes are more like fixed-wing aircraft . All spaceplanes to date have been rocket-powered but then landed as unpowered gliders ."
"A supersonic transport ( SST ) is a civilian supersonic aircraft designed to transport passengers at speeds greater than the speed of sound . To date , the only SSTs to see regular service have been Concorde and the Tupolev Tu-144 . The last passenger flight of the Tu-144 was in June 1978 and it was last flown in 1999 by NASA . Concorde 's last commercial flight was in October 2003 , with a November 26 , 2003 ferry flight being its last airborne operation . Following the permanent cessation of flying by Concorde , there are no remaining SSTs in commercial service . Several companies have each proposed a supersonic business jet , which may bring supersonic transport back again ."
"Vehicular communication systems are computer networks in which vehicles and roadside units are the communicating nodes , providing each other with information , such as safety warnings and traffic information . They can be effective in avoiding accidents and traffic congestion . Both types of nodes are dedicated short-range communications ( DSRC ) devices . DSRC works in 5.9 GHz band with bandwidth of 75 MHz and approximate range of 300 m. [ 1 ] Vehicular communications is usually developed as a part of intelligent transportation systems ( ITS ) ."
