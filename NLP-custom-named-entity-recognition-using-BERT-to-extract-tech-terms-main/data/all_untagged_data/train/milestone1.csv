The gene-editing technique CRISPR earned the 2020 Nobel Prize in chemistry . Recognition of this amazing breakthrough technology is well deserved .
"But each Nobel Prize can be awarded to no more than three people , and that ’ s where this year ’ s prize gets really interesting ."
"The decision to award the prize to Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier involves geopolitics and patent law , and it pits basic science against applied science ."
"CRISPR is a powerful gene-editing tool that has taken molecular biology from the typewriter to the word processor age . One could say it ’ s like Microsoft Word for the book of life . CRISPR allows a researcher to find not just a gene , but a very specific part of a gene and change it , delete it or add a completely foreign gene . Genetic modifications that used to take sophisticated biological laboratories years to do are now done in days and at significantly less cost ."
"The CRISPR story begins in 1987 , when molecular biologist Yoshizumi Ishino and his co-workers discovered a strange palindromic stretch of DNA in E. coli , a commonly studied stomach bacteria . No one could imagine what purpose it served ."
"By 2002 , DNA sequencing methods were cheaper and more common , and researchers had found Ishino ’ s repeat sequences in nearly half of all bacteria and most of the single-celled archaea that had been sequenced . At this point there were enough puzzle pieces for Francisco Mojica at the University of Alicante and Ruud Jansen at Utrecht University to come up with a great acronym : CRISPR – for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats ."
"at the National Center for Biotechnology Information in Bethesda , Maryland , Eugene Koonin established the odd DNA ’ s function as a bacterial defense system composed of two parts ."
The second component of the bacterial defense system is a search-and-destroy weapon .
3D printed parts developed by the Department of Energy at Oak Ridge National Laboratory ( ORNL ) could be tested in currently operating nuclear reactors as early as spring 2021 .
"introduce additively manufactured parts into nuclear reactors , using the same techniques being developed under the ORNL-led Transformational Challenge Reactor ( TCR ) demonstration program to explore faster and cheaper nuclear energy distribution within the US ."
The TCR is a microreactor built via 3D printing and other advanced technologies that aims to be operational by 2024 .
"In addition to being the first 3D printed parts to be installed in a nuclear reactor , they will also be the first physical parts with digital twins created using TCR ’ s advanced monitoring and artificial intelligence ( AI ) technologies"
"Using a micro-welding process , the shape of the channel fastener can be altered in minuscule increments with the potential to provide a more cost-effective way to manufacture the part , which is traditionally cast and machined . The 3D printing of the part is also serving as a test case of TCR ’ s digital platform that is exploring ways to quickly certify the quality of components designed for nuclear reactors . Combining additive manufacturing and AI to monitor production processes and certify part quality is a key goal of the TCR program ."

"Lithium-ion batteries ( LIBs ) that function as high-performance power sources for renewable applications , such as electric vehicles and consumer electronics , require electrodes that deliver high energy density without compromising cell lifetimes"
"In the Journal of Vacuum Science and Technology A , by AIP Publishing , researchers investigate the origins of degradation in high energy density LIB cathode materials and develop strategies for mitigating those degradation mechanisms and improving LIB performance ."
"Their research could be valuable for many emerging applications , particularly electric vehicles and grid-level energy storage for renewable energy sources , such as wind and solar ."
"Most of the degradation mechanisms in LIBs occur at the electrode surfaces that are in contact with the electrolyte , said author Mark Hersam . `` We sought to understand the chemistry at these surfaces and then develop strategies for minimizing degradation . ''"
"The researchers employed surface chemical characterization as a strategy for identifying and minimizing residual hydroxide and carbonate impurities from the synthesis of NCA ( nickel , cobalt , aluminum ) nanoparticles . They realized the LIB cathode surfaces first needed to be prepared by suitable annealing , a process by which the cathode nanoparticles are heated to remove surface impurities , and then locked into the desirable structures with an atomically thin graphene coating ."
"The graphene-coated NCA nanoparticles , which were formulated into LIB cathodes , showed superlative electrochemical properties , including low impedance , high rate performance , high volumetric energy and power densities , and long cycling lifetimes . The graphene coating also acted as a barrier between the electrode surface and the electrolyte , which further improved cell lifetime ."

All of our materials are supplied with certificates of analysis that include electron microscopy , hydrodynamic diameter , and optical data for each batch to guarantee products meet specifications ."
Access control is a security technique that regulates who or what can view or use resources in a computing environment . It is a fundamental concept in security that minimizes risk to the business or organization .
"There are two types of access control : physical and logical . Physical access control limits access to campuses , buildings , rooms and physical IT assets . Logical access control limits connections to computer networks , system files and data ."
"To secure a facility , organizations use electronic access control systems that rely on user credentials , access card readers , auditing and reports to track employee access to restricted business locations and proprietary areas , such as data centers . Some of these systems incorporate access control panels to restrict entry to rooms and buildings as well as alarms and lock-down capabilities to prevent unauthorized access or operations ."
"Access control systems perform identification authentication and authorization of users and entities by evaluating required login credentials that can include passwords , personal identification numbers ( PINs ) , bio-metric scans , security tokens or other authentication factors . Multi-factor authentication , which requires two or more authentication factors , is often an important part of layered defense to protect access control systems ."
"With growing environmental concerns , climate change and extensive energy requirements for lifeline projects and communities around the world , many emerging economies established policies on alternative energy use and set national targets for a more sustainable future as they modernise their energy sector ."
"There is a growing trend for digitalisation and artificial intelligence ( AI ) with the use of big data to implement smarter ways in delivering the variable renewable energy ( VRE ) into the power grid – increased use of solar panels , wind turbines and other types of clean energy systems ."
"solar energy has become one of the crucial renewables to accelerate green growth . We can definitely expect more solar developments and projects , and this is evident by the upsurge of demand in photovoltaic ( PV ) panels ."
"MEMS are tiny , 3D-printed sensors designed to work in tandem ."
"Neural Dust : Berkeley teams have implanted smart dust sensors in rats to help monitor and control nerve and muscle activity . These tiny MEMS have no batteries , instead relying on ultrasound to both take measurements and draw power ."
"Automotive Safety : As noted by Electronics 360 , smart dust sensors are now being used to power safety mechanisms in vehicles . MEMS-based accelerometers in airbags have improved performance and reduced total cost , while government-manded tire pressure sensors can intelligently collect tire data using vibration as their power source ."

"In November , a team of MIT researchers sent samples of various high-tech fabrics , some with embedded sensors or electronics , to the International Space Station ."
"In November , a team of MIT researchers sent samples of various high-tech fabrics , some with embedded sensors or electronics , to the International Space Station . The samples – unpowered for now – will be exposed to the space environment for a year in order to determine a baseline for how well these materials survive the harsh environment of low Earth orbit ."
"The hope is that this work could lead to thermal blankets for spacecraft which act as sensitive detectors for impacting micrometeoroids and space debris . Ultimately , another goal is to create new smart fabrics that allow astronauts to feel touch through their pressurized suits ."
"Three members of MIT ’ s multidisciplinary team , graduate students Juliana Cherston of the Media Lab , and Yuchen Sun of the Department of Chemistry , and postdoc Wei Yan of the Research Laboratory of Electronics and the Department of Materials Science and Engineering , discussed the experiment ’ s ambitious aims with MIT News ."
"MIT News : Can you describe the fabric samples that you sent to the International Space Station , and what kinds of information you are hoping to get from them after their exposure in space ?"
"Juliana Cherston : The white colour of the International Space Station is actually a protective fabric material called Beta cloth , which is a Teflon-impregnated fibreglass designed to shield spacecraft and spacesuits from the harsh elements of low Earth orbit . For decades , these fabrics have remained electrically passive , despite offering large-area real estate on the exterior of space assets ."
"We imagine turning this spacecraft skin into an enormous space debris and micrometeoroid impact sensor . The samples that we worked with JAXA , the Japanese space agency , and Space BD to send to the International Space Station incorporate materials like charge-sensitive synthetic fur which was an early concept , and vibration-sensitive fibre sensors — our project ’ s focus — into space-resilient fabrics . The resulting fabric may be useful for detecting cosmic dust of scientific interest , and for damage detection on spacecraft ."
"It ’ s easy to assume that since we ’ re already sending these materials to space , the technology must be very mature . In reality , we are leveraging the space environment to complement our important ground-testing efforts . All of these fabric sensors will remain unpowered for this first in-space test , and the quilt of samples occupies a total area of 10 by 10 centimetres on the exterior walls of the station ."
"Our focus is on baselining their resiliency to the space environment . In one year , these samples will return to Earth for postflight analysis . We ’ ll be able to measure any erosion from atomic oxygen , discoloration from UV radiation , and any changes to fibre sensor performance after one year of thermal cycling . There is some chance that we will also find hints of micron-scale micrometeoroids . We ’ re also already preparing for an electrically powered deployment currently scheduled for late 2021 or early 2022 ( recently awarded to the project by the ISS National Lab ) . At that point we ’ ll apply an additional protective coating to the fibres and actually operate them in space ."
"The fabric samples contain thermally drawn ‘ acoustic ’ fibres developed with ISN funding that are capable of converting mechanical vibration energy into electric energy ( via the piezoelectric effect ) . When micrometeoroids or space debris hit the fabric , the fabric vibrates , and the acoustic fibre generates an electrical signal . Thermally drawn multimaterial fibres have been developed by our research group at MIT for more than 20 years . What makes these fibres special is their exquisite sensitivity to mechanical vibrations . The fabric has been shown in ground facilities to detect and measure impact regardless of where the space dust impacted the surface of the fabric ."
"I am particularly keen to demonstrate that instrumentation useful for fundamental scientific inquiry can be incorporated directly into the fabric skin of persistent spacecraft , which to date is unused and very precious real estate . In particular , I am beginning to evaluate whether these skins are sensitive enough to detect cosmic dust produced in million-year-old supernova explosions tens or hundreds of light-years away from Earth . Just last year , an isotopic signature for this type of interstellar dust was discovered in fresh Antarctic snow , so we believe that some of this dust is still whizzing around the solar system , holding clues about the dynamics of supernova explosions . In-situ characterization of their distribution and kinematics is currently my most ambitious scientific goal ."
"More generally , I ’ d love to see advanced fibres and fabrics tackle other questions of fundamental physical interest in space , maybe by leveraging optical fibres or radiation sensitive materials to create large aperture sensors ."
"Some students in my group have also developed a conceptual prototype in which sensory data on the exterior skin of a pressurized spacesuit armband is mapped to haptic actuators on the wearer ’ s biological skin . Using this system , astronauts will be able to feel texture and touch right through their spacesuits . This direct experience of a new environment is very central to humanity ’ s drive to explore ."
"An impact-sensitive skin can also be used for damage detection on persistent space craft . In practice , the fabric ’ s ability to localise damage from space debris and micrometeoroids is how we will really sell the concept to aerospace engineers ."
"Although the space age began 63 years ago when Soviet Union ’ s Sputnik 1 was launched into an elliptical low Earth orbit , many unanswered questions remain regarding the effect of the space environment on humans , as well as the safety of astronauts as they operate in the space environment . While our project ’ s main focus has been on augmenting fabrics used on the exterior of spacecraft , I also envision that future spacesuits will be electrically active and highly multifunctional ."
"Fabrics might even serve as part of an exoskeleton that assists astronauts in manoeuvring on planetary bodies and in microgravity . One broad vision at play is to pack an enormous amount of function into space resilient textiles , creating an analogue of Moore ’ s Law for space fabrics ."
"Space is definitely a new frontier for our research , while lots of terrestrial applications have been envisaged in ambient conditions and even under water . From low Earth orbit to planetary bodies , space is a unique environment with atomic oxygen , radiation , high speed impactors , and extreme temperature cycling . How will the fibres and fabrics perform there and what changes will be induced in the fibre materials ? How should electronic fabrics be designed in order to meet the demands of aerospace applications ? There are so many scientific and technological questions ."
"Our group with professor of chemistry Keith Nelson strives to push the limits of what is experimentally achievable for impact testing , and we are always excited by a new challenge . Recently , we have been venturing into the area of high-speed mechanics , testing novel materials spanning polymers , thin films , and nanoarchitected materials using a laser accelerator facility designed by our lab to impinge tiny particles on target surfaces at speeds exceeding 1 kilometer per second ."
"When the idea emerged to test a material capable of detecting impact signatures in low Earth orbit and beyond , there was immediate interest on our side , since it is fundamentally different from our previous research focus . These experiments are certainly more difficult and complex than what we are used to , with many more active parts to maintain . I think we were all quite pleasantly surprised when our preliminary impact experiments were successful and encouraging ."
"While space launches are exciting , in reality some of our most convincing data to date has come from impact testing on the ground . Initially , it was not at all obvious that a fabric sensor with sparsely integrated sensing elements could actually detect such small and fast particles . There were a really great few minutes at our first serious impact testing campaign during which Yuchen gradually increased the number of particles accelerated onto our sensor , while holding all other aspects of the experiment constant . The growing signal was a smoking gun indication that we were seeing a true impact signature ."
"On a personal level , I ’ m really fascinated by the idea of leveraging very unconventional technology like fabrics for questions of scientific significance . And I think the idea of feeling right through a pressurized spacesuit is delightful ."

Crystalline 'nanobrush ' clears way to advanced energy and information tech
A team led by the Department of Energy 's Oak Ridge National Laboratory synthesized a tiny structure with high surface area and discovered how its unique architecture drives ions across interfaces to transport energy or information . Their `` nanobrush '' contains bristles made of alternating crystal sheets with vertically aligned interfaces and plentiful pores .
"These are major technical accomplishments and may prove useful in advancing energy and information technologies , said ORNL 's Ho Nyung Lee , who led the study published in Nature Communications . `` This is an excellent example of work that is only feasible with the unique expertise and capabilities available at national labs . ''"
"The team 's researchers hail from DOE national labs Oak Ridge and Argonne and Massachusetts Institute of Technology , or MIT , University of South Carolina , Columbia , and University of Tennessee , Knoxville ."
"The bristles of their multilayer crystal , or `` supercrystal , '' are grown freestanding on a substrate . Former ORNL postdoctoral fellow Dongkyu Lee synthesized the supercrystals using pulsed laser epitaxy to deposit and build up alternating layers of fluorite-structure cerium oxide ( CeO2 ) and bixbyite-structure yttrium oxide ( Y2O3 ) . Realization of the nanoscale bristles was made possible by the development of a novel precision synthesis approach that controls atom diffusion and aggregation during the growth of thin-film materials . Using scanning transmission electron microscopy , or STEM , former ORNL postdoctoral fellow Xiang Gao was surprised to discover atomically precise crystalline interfaces within the bristles ."
"To see the distribution of CeO2 and Y2O3 within the nanobrush , ORNL 's Jonathan Poplawsky measured samples from the bristles using atom probe tomography , or APT , at the Center for Nanophase Materials Sciences , a DOE Office of Science User Facility at ORNL . `` APT is the only technique available that is capable of probing the three-dimensional positions of atoms in a material with sub-nanometer resolution and 10 parts per million chemical sensitivity , '' Poplawsky said . `` APT clarifies the local distributions of atoms within a nanosized object and was an excellent platform for providing information about the 3-D structure of the interface between the cerium oxide and yttrium oxide layers . ''"
"For a 2017 paper , the ORNL-led researchers used epitaxy by pulsed laser deposition to precisely synthesize nanobrushes with bristles containing only one compound . For the 2020 paper , they used the same method to layer two compounds , CeO2 and Y2O3 , fabricating the first hybrid bristles with interfaces between the two materials . Traditionally , interfaces are aligned laterally by layering different crystals in thin films , whereas in the novel nanobrushes when grown on a particular surface , interfaces are aligned vertically through surface energy minimization in bristles that are only 10 nanometers wide—about 10,000 times thinner than a human hair ."
"This is a truly innovative way to build crystalline nanoarchitectures , providing unprecedented vertical interfaces that were never thought viable , Ho Nyung Lee said . `` You can not achieve these perfect crystalline architectures from any other synthesis method . ''"
"He added , `` There are many ways to utilize interfaces , which is why 2000 Nobel Prize winner Herbert Kroemer said , 'the interface is the device . ' '' Conventionally , depositing layers of thin film materials on substrates creates interfaces that are horizontally aligned , allowing ions or electrons to move along the substrate 's 2-D plane . The ORNL-led achievement is proof of concept that it is possible to create vertically aligned interfaces through which electrons or ions can be transported out of the substrate 's plane . Moreover , architectures like the nanobrush could be combined with other nanoscale architectures to create devices for quantum technologies and sensing as well as energy storage ."
"The low-energy configuration of the fluorite structure caused the formation of unique chevron patterns , or inverted `` V '' shapes . A slight mismatch between different structures of fluorite and bixbyite crystal subunits causes mismatch of the electronic charges at their interfaces , causing oxygen atoms to vacate the fluorite side , which leads to the formation of functional defects . The spaces that are left behind can form interfacial oxygen ions and create an atomic-scale channel through which the ions can flow . `` We are using the interfaces not only to artificially create oxygen ions , but also to guide ion movement in a more deliberate way , '' Lee said ."
"With the help of ORNL 's Matthew Chisholm , Gao used STEM to uncover the atomic structure of the crystal and electron energy-loss spectroscopy to reveal chemical and electronic insights about the interface . `` We observed that a quarter of oxygen atoms are lost at the interfaces , '' said Chisholm . `` We were also surprised by the chevron growth pattern . It was critical at the beginning to really understand how the interfaces form within the bristles . ''"
"The nanobrush has a high porosity , and its architecture is advantageous for applications needing large surface area to maximize electronic and chemical interactions , such as sensors , membranes and electrodes . But how could the scientists determine the porosity of their material ? Neutrons—neutral particles that pass through materials without destroying them—provided an excellent tool for characterizing porosity of the bulk material . The scientists used resources of the Spallation Neutron Source , a DOE Office of Science User Facility at ORNL , for extended Q-range small-angle neutron scattering that determined the upper limit of porosity to be 49 % . `` Quickly grown bristles can provide about 200 times as much surface area as a 2-D thin film , '' said ORNL co-author Michael Fitzsimmons ."
"He added , `` What we learn may advance applications of neutron science in the process . Whereas thin films do not provide sufficient surface area for neutron spectroscopy studies , ORNL 's novel nanobrush architecture does , and could be a platform for learning more about interfacial materials when an even brighter neutron beam becomes available at SNS 's Second Target Station , which is a funded construction project . ''"
Theoretical calculations of the material system from the electronic and atomic level supported findings about oxygen-vacancy creation at the interfaces . MIT contributor Lixin Sun performed density functional theory calculations and molecular dynamics simulations under the direction of Bilge Yildiz .
"Our theoretical calculations revealed how this interface can accommodate a largely different chemistry at this type of unique interface compared to bulk materials , said Yildiz . The MIT calculations predicted the energy needed to remove a neutral oxygen atom to form a vacancy close to the interface or in the middle of a cerium oxide layer . `` In particular , we found that a large fraction of oxygen ions is removed at the interface without deteriorating the lattice structure . ''"
"Lee said , `` Indeed , these critical interfaces could form inside of nanobrush architectures , making them more promising than conventional thin films in many technological applications . Their much greater surface area and larger number of interfaces—potentially , thousands inside each bristle—may prove a game changer in future technologies in which the interface is the device . ''"
"3D printing , or additive manufacturing , is the construction of a three-dimensional object from a CAD model or a digital 3D model . [ 1 ] The term `` 3D printing '' can refer to a variety of processes in which material is deposited , joined or solidified under computer control to create a three-dimensional object , [ 2 ] with material being added together ( such as liquid molecules or powder grains being fused together ) , typically layer by layer ."
"The umbrella term additive manufacturing ( AM ) gained popularity in the 2000s , [ 5 ] inspired by the theme of material being added together ( in any of various ways ) . In contrast , the term subtractive manufacturing appeared as a retronym for the large family of machining processes with material removal as their common process . The term 3D printing still referred only to the polymer technologies in most minds , and the term AM was more likely to be used in metalworking and end-use part production contexts than among polymer , inkjet , or stereolithography enthusiasts . Inkjet was the least familiar technology even though it was invented in 1950 and poorly understood because of its complex nature ."
"Other terms that have been used as synonyms or hypernyms have included desktop manufacturing , rapid manufacturing ( as the logical production-level successor to rapid prototyping ) , and on-demand manufacturing ( which echoes on-demand printing in the 2D sense of printing ) . Such application of the adjectives rapid and on-demand to the noun manufacturing was novel in the 2000s reveals the prevailing mental model of the long industrial era in which almost all production manufacturing involved long lead times for laborious tooling development ."
"Today , the term subtractive has not replaced the term machining , instead complementing it when a term that covers any removal method is needed . Agile tooling is the use of modular means to design tooling that is produced by additive manufacturing or 3D printing methods to enable quick prototyping and responses to tooling and fixture needs . Agile tooling uses a cost-effective and high-quality method to quickly respond to customer and market needs , and it can be used in hydro-forming , stamping , injection molding and other manufacturing processes ."
"The general concept of and procedure to be used in 3D-printing was first described by Raymond F. Jones in his story , `` Tools of the Trade , '' published in the November 1950 issue of Astounding Science Fiction magazine . He referred to it as a `` molecular spray '' in that story ."
"In 1971 , Johannes F Gottwald patented the Liquid Metal Recorder , US3596285A , a continuous Inkjet metal material device to form a removable metal fabrication on a reusable surface for immediate use or salvaged for printing again by remelting . This appears to be the first patent describing 3D printing with rapid prototyping and controlled on-demand manufacturing of patterns ."
"In April 1980 , Hideo Kodama of Nagoya Municipal Industrial Research Institute invented two additive methods for fabricating three-dimensional plastic models with photo-hardening thermoset polymer , where the UV exposure area is controlled by a mask pattern or a scanning fiber transmitter . [ 11 ] He filed a patent for this XYZ plotter , which was published on 10 November 1981 ."
"However , there was no reaction to the series of his publications . His device was not highly evaluated in the laboratory and his boss did not show any interest . His research budget was just 60,000 yen or $ 545 a year . Acquiring the patent rights for the XYZ plotter was abandoned , and the project was terminated ."
"In 2 July 1984 , American entrepreneur Bill Masters filed a patent for his Computer Automated Manufacturing Process and System ( US 4665492 ) . [ 15 ] This filing is on record at the USPTO as the first 3D printing patent in history ; it was the first of three patents belonging to Masters that laid the foundation for the 3D printing systems used today ."
"On 16 July 1984 , Alain Le Méhauté , Olivier de Witte , and Jean Claude André filed their patent for the stereolithography process . [ 18 ] The application of the French inventors was abandoned by the French General Electric Company ( now Alcatel-Alsthom ) and CILAS ( The Laser Consortium ) . [ 19 ] The claimed reason was `` for lack of business perspective ''"
"In 1983 , Robert Howard started R.H. Research , later named Howtek , Inc. in Feb 1984 to develop a color inkjet 2D printer , Pixelmaster , commercialized in 1986 , using Thermoplastic ( hot-melt ) plastic ink . [ 21 ] A team was put together , 6 members [ 21 ] from Exxon Office Systems , Danbury Systems Division , an inkjet printer startup and some members of Howtek , Inc group who became popular figures in 3D Printing Industry . One Howtek member , Richard Helinski patent US5136515A , Method and Means for constructing three-dimensional articles by particle deposition , application 11/07/1989 granted 8/04/1992 formed a New Hampshire company C.A.D-Cast , Inc , name later changed to Visual Impact Corporation ( VIC ) on 8/22/1991 ."
"A prototype of the VIC 3D printer for this company is available with a video presentation showing a 3D model printed with a single nozzle inkjet . Another employee Herbert Menhennett formed a New Hampshire company HM Research in 1991 and introduced the Howtek , Inc , inkjet technology and thermoplastic materials to Royden Sanders of SDI and Bill Masters of Ballistic Particle Manufacturing ( BPM ) where he worked for a number of years . Both BPM 3D printers and SPI 3D printers use Howtek , Inc style Inkjets and Howtek , Inc style materials . Royden Sanders licensed the Helinksi patent prior to manufacturing the Modelmaker 6 Pro at Sanders prototype , Inc ( SPI ) in 1993 . James K. McMahon who was hired by Howtek , Inc to help develop the inkjet , later worked at Sanders Prototype and now operates Layer Grown Model Technology , a 3D service provider specializing in Howtek single nozzle inkjet and SDI printer support ."
"James K. McMahon worked with Steven Zoltan , 1972 drop-on-demand inkjet inventor , at Exxon and has a patent in 1978 that expanded the understanding of the single nozzle design inkjets ( Alpha jets ) and help perfect the Howtek , Inc hot-melt inkjets . This Howtek hot-melt thermoplastic technology is popular with metal investment casting , especially in the 3D printing jewelry industry . [ 22 ] Sanders ( SDI ) first Modelmaker 6Pro customer was Hitchner Corporations , Metal Casting Technology , Inc in Milford , NH a mile from the SDI facility in late 1993-1995 casting golf clubs and auto engine parts ."
"On 8 August 1984 a patent , US4575330 , assigned to UVP , Inc. , later assigned to Chuck Hull of 3D Systems Corporation [ 23 ] was filed , his own patent for a stereolithography fabrication system , in which individual laminae or layers are added by curing photopolymers with impinging radiation , particle bombardment , chemical reaction or just ultraviolet light lasers . Hull defined the process as a `` system for generating three-dimensional objects by creating a cross-sectional pattern of the object to be formed , ''"
"Hull 's contribution was the STL ( Stereolithography ) file format and the digital slicing and infill strategies common to many processes today . In 1986 , Charles `` Chuck '' Hull was granted a patent for this system , and his company , 3D Systems Corporation was formed and it released the first commercial 3D printer , the SLA-1 . [ 26 ] later in 1987 or 1988 ."
"The technology used by most 3D printers to date—especially hobbyist and consumer-oriented models—is fused deposition modeling , a special application of plastic extrusion , developed in 1988 by S. Scott Crump and commercialized by his company Stratasys , which marketed its first FDM machine in 1992 ."
"AM processes for metal sintering or melting ( such as selective laser sintering , direct metal laser sintering , and selective laser melting ) usually went by their own individual names in the 1980s and 1990s . At the time , all metalworking was done by processes that are now called non-additive ( casting , fabrication , stamping , and machining ) ; although plenty of automation was applied to those technologies ( such as by robot welding and CNC ) , the idea of a tool or head moving through a 3D work envelope transforming a mass of raw material into a desired shape with a toolpath was associated in metalworking only with processes that removed metal ( rather than adding it ) , such as CNC milling , CNC EDM , and many others ."
"But the automated techniques that added metal , which would later be called additive manufacturing , were beginning to challenge that assumption . By the mid-1990s , new techniques for material deposition were developed at Stanford and Carnegie Mellon University , including microcasting [ 27 ] and sprayed materials . [ 28 ] Sacrificial and support materials had also become more common , enabling new object geometries ."
"The term 3D printing originally referred to a powder bed process employing standard and custom inkjet print heads , developed at MIT by Emanuel Sachs in 1993 and commercialized by Soligen Technologies , Extrude Hone Corporation , and Z Corporation"
"The year 1993 also saw the start of an inkjet 3D printer company initially named Sanders Prototype , Inc and later named Solidscape , introducing a high-precision polymer jet fabrication system with soluble support structures , ( categorized as a `` dot-on-dot '' technique ) ."
Fused Deposition Modeling ( FDM ) printing process patents expired in 2009 .
"As the various additive processes matured , it became clear that soon metal removal would no longer be the only metalworking process done through a tool or head moving through a 3D work envelope , transforming a mass of raw material into a desired shape layer by layer . The 2010s were the first decade in which metal end use parts such as engine brackets [ 31 ] and large nuts [ 32 ] would be grown ( either before or instead of machining ) in job production rather than obligately being machined from bar stock or plate . It is still the case that casting , fabrication , stamping , and machining are more prevalent than additive manufacturing in metalworking , but AM is now beginning to make significant inroads , and with the advantages of design for additive manufacturing , it is clear to engineers that much more is to come ."
"One place that AM is making a significant inroad is in the aviation industry . With nearly 3.8 billion air travelers in 2016 , [ 33 ] the demand for fuel efficient and easily produced jet engines has never been higher . For large OEMs ( original equipment manufacturers ) like Pratt and Whitney ( PW ) and General Electric ( GE ) this means looking towards AM as a way to reduce cost , reduce the number of nonconforming parts , reduce weight in the engines to increase fuel efficiency and find new , highly complex shapes that would not be feasible with the antiquated manufacturing methods ."
"One example of AM integration with aerospace was in 2016 when Airbus was delivered the first of GE ’ s LEAP engine . This engine has integrated 3D printed fuel nozzles giving them a reduction in parts from 20 to 1 , a 25 % weight reduction and reduced assembly times . [ 34 ] A fuel nozzle is the perfect in road for additive manufacturing in a jet engine since it allows for optimized design of the complex internals and it is a low stress , non-rotating part ."
"Similarly , in 2015 , PW delivered their first AM parts in the PurePower PW1500G to Bombardier . Sticking to low stress , non-rotating parts , PW selected the compressor stators and synch ring brackets [ 35 ] to roll out this new manufacturing technology for the first time . While AM is still playing a small role in the total number of parts in the jet engine manufacturing process , the return on investment can already be seen by the reduction in parts , the rapid production capabilities and the `` optimized design in terms of performance and cost '' ."
"As technology matured , several authors had begun to speculate that 3D printing could aid in sustainable development in the developing world ."
"In 2012 , Filabot developed a system for closing the loop [ 38 ] with plastic and allows for any FDM or FFF 3D printer to be able to print with a wider range of plastics"
"In 2014 , Benjamin S. Cook and Manos M. Tentzeris demonstrate the first multi-material , vertically integrated printed electronics additive manufacturing platform ( VIPRE ) which enabled 3D printing of functional electronics operating up to 40 GHz ."
"The term `` 3D printing '' originally referred to a process that deposits a binder material onto a powder bed with inkjet printer heads layer by layer . More recently , the popular vernacular has started using the term to encompass a wider variety of additive-manufacturing techniques such as electron-beam additive manufacturing and selective laser melting . The United States and global technical standards use the official term additive manufacturing for this broader sense ."
"The most-commonly used 3D printing process ( 46 % as of 2018 ) is a material extrusion technique called fused deposition modeling , or FDM . [ 4 ] While FDM technology was invented after the other two most popular technologies , stereolithography ( SLA ) and selective laser sintering ( SLS ) , FDM is typically the most inexpensive of the three by a large margin , [ citation needed ] which lends to the popularity of the process ."
"3D printable models may be created with a computer-aided design ( CAD ) package , via a 3D scanner , or by a plain digital camera and photogrammetry software . 3D printed models created with CAD result in relatively fewer errors than other methods . Errors in 3D printable models can be identified and corrected before printing . [ 40 ] The manual modeling process of preparing geometric data for 3D computer graphics is similar to plastic arts such as sculpting . 3D scanning is a process of collecting digital data on the shape and appearance of a real object , creating a digital model based on it ."
"CAD models can be saved in the stereolithography file format ( STL ) , a de facto CAD file format for additive manufacturing that stores data based on triangulations of the surface of CAD models . STL is not tailored for additive manufacturing because it generates large file sizes of topology optimized parts and lattice structures due to the large number of surfaces involved . A newer CAD file format , the Additive Manufacturing File format ( AMF ) was introduced in 2011 to solve this problem . It stores information using curved triangulations"
A step in the STL generation known as `` repair '' fixes such problems in the original model . [ 45 ] [ 46 ] Generally STLs that have been produced from a model obtained through 3D scanning often have more of these errors [ 47 ] as 3D scanning is often achieved by point to point acquisition/mapping . 3D reconstruction often includes errors
"Once completed , the STL file needs to be processed by a piece of software called a `` slicer , '' which converts the model into a series of thin layers and produces a G-code file containing instructions tailored to a specific type of 3D printer ( FDM printers ) . [ 49 ] This G-code file can then be printed with 3D printing client software ( which loads the G-code , and uses it to instruct the 3D printer during the 3D printing process )"
"Printer resolution describes layer thickness and X–Y resolution in dots per inch ( dpi ) or micrometers ( µm ) . Typical layer thickness is around 100 µm ( 250 DPI ) , although some machines can print layers as thin as 16 µm ( 1,600 DPI ) . [ 50 ] X–Y resolution is comparable to that of laser printers . The particles ( 3D dots ) are around 50 to 100 µm ( 510 to 250 DPI ) in diameter . [ citation needed ] For that printer resolution , specifying a mesh resolution of 0.01–0.03 mm and a chord length = 0.016 mm generate an optimal STL output file for a given model input file . [ 51 ] Specifying higher resolution results in larger files without increase in print quality ."
"Construction of a model with contemporary methods can take anywhere from several hours to several days , depending on the method used and the size and complexity of the model . Additive systems can typically reduce this time to a few hours , although it varies widely depending on the type of machine used and the size and number of models being produced simultaneously ."
"Though the printer-produced resolution is sufficient for many applications , greater accuracy can be achieved by printing a slightly oversized version of the desired object in standard resolution and then removing material using a higher-resolution subtractive process ."
The layered structure of all Additive Manufacturing processes leads inevitably to a stair-stepping effect on part surfaces which are curved or tilted in respect to the building platform . The effects strongly depend on the orientation of a part surface inside the building process .
"Some printable polymers such as ABS , allow the surface finish to be smoothed and improved using chemical vapor processes [ 54 ] based on acetone or similar solvents ."
"Some additive manufacturing techniques are capable of using multiple materials in the course of constructing parts . These techniques are able to print in multiple colors and color combinations simultaneously , and would not necessarily require painting ."
Some printing techniques require internal supports to be built for overhanging features during construction . These supports must be mechanically removed or dissolved upon completion of the print .
All of the commercialized metal 3D printers involve cutting the metal component off the metal substrate after deposition . A new process for the GMAW 3D printing allows for substrate surface modifications to remove aluminum [ 55 ] or steel .
"Traditionally , 3D printing focused on polymers for printing , due to the ease of manufacturing and handling polymeric materials . However , the method has rapidly evolved to not only print various polymers [ 57 ] but also metals [ 58 ] [ 59 ] and ceramics , [ 60 ] making 3D printing a versatile option for manufacturing . Layer-by-layer fabrication of three-dimensional physical models is a modern concept that `` stems from the ever-growing CAD industry , more specifically the solid modeling side of CAD ."
"Before solid modeling was introduced in the late 1980s , three-dimensional models were created with wire frames and surfaces . '' [ 61 ] but in all cases the layers of materials are controlled by the printer and the material properties . The three-dimensional material layer is controlled by deposition rate as set by the printer operator and stored in a computer file . The earliest printed patented material was a Hot melt type ink for printing patterns using a heated metal alloy . See 1970 's history above ."
"A drawback of many existing 3D printing technologies is that they only allow one material to be printed at a time , limiting many potential applications which require the integration of different materials in the same object . Multi-material 3D printing solves this problem by allowing objects of complex and heterogeneous arrangements of materials to be manufactured using a single printer . Here , a material must be specified for each voxel ( or 3D printing pixel element ) inside the final object volume ."
"The process can be fraught with complications , however , due to the isolated and monolithic algorithms . Some commercial devices have sought to solve these issues , such as building a Spec2Fab translator , but the progress is still very limited . [ 62 ] Nonetheless , in the medical industry , a concept of 3D printed pills and vaccines has been presented . [ 63 ] With this new concept , multiple medications can be combined , which will decrease many risks . With more and more applications of multi-material 3D printing , the costs of daily life and high technology development will become inevitably lower ."
"Metallographic materials of 3D printing is also being researched . [ 64 ] By classifying each material , CIMP-3D can systematically perform 3D printing with multiple materials ."
"Using 3D printing and multi-material structures in additive manufacturing has allowed for the design and creation of what is called 4D printing . 4D printing is an additive manufacturing process in which the printed object changes shape with time , temperature , or some other type of stimulation . 4D printing allows for the creation of dynamic structures with adjustable shapes , properties or functionality . The smart/stimulus responsive materials that are created using 4D printing can be activated to create calculated responses such as self-assembly , self-repair , multi-functionality , reconfiguration and shape shifting . This allows for customized printing of shape changing and shape-memory materials ."
"4D printing has the potential to find new applications and uses for materials ( plastics , composites , metals , etc . ) and will create new alloys and composites that were not viable before . The versatility of this technology and materials can lead to advances in multiple fields of industry , including space , commercial and the medical field . The repeatability , precision , and material range for 4D printing must increase to allow the process to become more practical throughout these industries ."
"To become a viable industrial production option , there are a couple of challenges that 4D printing must overcome . The challenges of 4D printing include the fact that the microstructures of these printed smart materials must be close to or better than the parts obtained through traditional machining processes . New and customizable materials need to be developed that have the ability to consistently respond to varying external stimuli and change to their desired shape . There is also a need to design new software for the various technique types of 4D printing . The 4D printing software will need to take into consideration the base smart material , printing technique , and structural and geometric requirements of the design ."
"ISO/ASTM52900-15 defines seven categories of Additive Manufacturing ( AM ) processes within its meaning : binder jetting , directed energy deposition , material extrusion , material jetting , powder bed fusion , sheet lamination , and vat photopolymerization ."
The first process where three-dimensional material is deposited to form an object was done with Material Jetting [ 22 ] or as it was originally called particle deposition . Particle deposition by inkjet first started with Continuous Inkjet technology ( CIT ) ( 1950 's ) and later with drop-On-Demand Inkjet technology . ( 1970 's ) using Hot-melt inks . Wax inks were the first three-dimensional materials jetted and later low temperature alloy metal was jetted with CIT . Wax and thermoplastic hot-melts were jetted next by DOD .
"Objects were very small and started with text characters and numerals for signage . An object must have form and can be handled . Wax characters tumbled off paper documents and inspired a Liquid Metal Recorder patent to make metal characters for signage in 1971 . Thermoplastic color inks ( CMYK ) printed with layers of each color to form the first digitally formed layered objects in 1984 . The idea of investment casting with Solid-Ink jetted images or patterns in 1984 led to the first patent to form articles from particle deposition in 1989 , issued in 1992 ."
"Some methods melt or soften the material to produce the layers . In Fused filament fabrication , also known as Fused deposition modeling ( FDM ) , the model or part is produced by extruding small beads or streams of material which harden immediately to form layers . A filament of thermoplastic , metal wire , or other material is fed into an extrusion nozzle head ( 3D printer extruder ) , which heats the material and turns the flow on and off . FDM is somewhat restricted in the variation of shapes that may be fabricated . Another technique fuses parts of the layer and then moves upward in the working area , adding another layer of granules and repeating the process until the piece has built up ."
"This process uses the unfused media to support overhangs and thin walls in the part being produced , which reduces the need for temporary auxiliary supports for the piece . [ 73 ] Recently , FFF/FDM has expanded to 3-D print directly from pellets to avoid the conversion to filament . This process is called fused particle fabrication ( FPF ) ( or fused granular fabrication ( FGF ) and has the potential to use more recycled materials ."
"Powder Bed Fusion techniques , or PBF , include several processes such as DMLS , SLS , SLM , MJF and EBM . Powder Bed Fusion processes can be used with an array of materials and their flexibility allows for geometrically complex structures , [ 75 ] making it a go to choice for many 3D printing projects . These techniques include selective laser sintering , with both metals and polymers , and direct metal laser sintering . [ 76 ] Selective laser melting does not use sintering for the fusion of powder granules but will completely melt the powder using a high-energy laser to create fully dense materials in a layer-wise method that has mechanical properties similar to those of conventional manufactured metals ."
"Electron beam melting is a similar type of additive manufacturing technology for metal parts ( e.g . titanium alloys ) . EBM manufactures parts by melting metal powder layer by layer with an electron beam in a high vacuum . [ 77 ] [ 78 ] Another method consists of an inkjet 3D printing system , which creates the model one layer at a time by spreading a layer of powder ( plaster , or resins ) and printing a binder in the cross-section of the part using an inkjet-like process . With laminated object manufacturing , thin layers are cut to shape and joined together . In addition to the previously mentioned methods , HP has developed the Multi Jet Fusion ( MJF ) which is a powder base technique , though no laser are involved . An inkjet array applies fusing and detailing agents which are then combined by heating to create a solid layer ."
"Other methods cure liquid materials using different sophisticated technologies , such as stereolithography . Photopolymerization is primarily used in stereolithography to produce a solid part from a liquid . Inkjet printer systems like the Objet PolyJet system spray photopolymer materials onto a build tray in ultra-thin layers ( between 16 and 30 µm ) until the part is completed . [ 80 ] Each photopolymer layer is cured with UV light after it is jetted , producing fully cured models that can be handled and used immediately , without post-curing ."
"Ultra-small features can be made with the 3D micro-fabrication technique used in multiphoton photopolymerisation . Due to the nonlinear nature of photo excitation , the gel is cured to a solid only in the places where the laser was focused while the remaining gel is then washed away . Feature sizes of under 100 nm are easily produced , as well as complex structures with moving and interlocked parts . [ 81 ] Yet another approach uses a synthetic resin that is solidified using LEDs"
"In Mask-image-projection-based stereolithography , a 3D digital model is sliced by a set of horizontal planes . Each slice is converted into a two-dimensional mask image . The mask image is then projected onto a photocurable liquid resin surface and light is projected onto the resin to cure it in the shape of the layer . [ 83 ] Continuous liquid interface production begins with a pool of liquid photopolymer resin ."
"Part of the pool bottom is transparent to ultraviolet light ( the `` window '' ) , which causes the resin to solidify . The object rises slowly enough to allow resin to flow under and maintain contact with the bottom of the object . [ 84 ] In powder-fed directed-energy deposition , a high-power laser is used to melt metal powder supplied to the focus of the laser beam . The powder fed directed energy process is similar to Selective Laser Sintering , but the metal powder is applied only where material is being added to the part at that moment"
"As of December 2017 , additive manufacturing systems were on the market that ranged from $ 99 to $ 500,000 in price and were employed in industries including aerospace , architecture , automotive , defense , and medical replacements , among many others . For example , General Electric uses high-end 3D Printers to build parts for turbines . [ 87 ] Many of these systems are used for rapid prototyping , before mass production methods are employed . Higher education has proven to be a major buyer of desktop and professional 3D printers which industry experts generally view as a positive indicator ."
"Libraries around the world have also become locations to house smaller 3D printers for educational and community access . [ 89 ] Several projects and companies are making efforts to develop affordable 3D printers for home desktop use . Much of this work has been driven by and targeted at DIY/Maker/enthusiast/early adopter communities , with additional ties to the academic and hacker communities ."
"Computed axial lithography is a method for 3D printing based on computerised tomography scans to create prints in photo-curable resin . It was developed by a collaboration between the University of California , Berkeley with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory . [ 91 ] [ 92 ] [ 93 ] Unlike other methods of 3D printing it does not build models through depositing layers of material like fused deposition modelling and stereolithography , instead it creates objects using a series of 2D images projected onto a cylinder of resin . [ 91 ] [ 93 ] It is notable for its ability to build an object much more quickly than other methods using resins and the ability to embed objects within the prints"
Liquid additive manufacturing ( LAM ) is a 3D printing technique which deposits a liquid or high viscose material ( e.g . Liquid Silicone Rubber ) onto a build surface to create an object which then is vulcanised using heat to harden the object . [ 94 ] [ 95 ] [ 96 ] The process was originally created by Adrian Bowyer and was then built upon by German RepRap .
"In the current scenario , 3D printing or additive manufacturing has been used in manufacturing , medical , industry and sociocultural sectors which facilitate 3D printing or Additive Manufacturing to become successful commercial technology . [ 99 ] More recently , 3D printing has also been used in the humanitarian and development sector to produce a range of medical items , prosthetics , spares and repairs . [ 100 ] The earliest application of additive manufacturing was on the toolroom end of the manufacturing spectrum . For example , rapid prototyping was one of the earliest additive variants , and its mission was to reduce the lead time and cost of developing prototypes of new parts and devices , which was earlier only done with subtractive toolroom methods such as CNC milling , turning , and precision grinding ."
"Additive manufacturing of food is being developed by squeezing out food , layer by layer , into three-dimensional objects . A large variety of foods are appropriate candidates , such as chocolate and candy , and flat foods such as crackers , pasta , [ 102 ] and pizza . [ 103 ] [ 104 ] NASA is looking into the technology in order to create 3D printed food to limit food waste and to make food that are designed to fit an astronaut 's dietary needs . [ 105 ] In 2018 , Italian bioengineer Giuseppe Scionti developed a technology allowing to generate fibrous plant-based meat analogues using a custom 3D bioprinter , mimicking meat texture and nutritional values"
"3D printing has entered the world of clothing , with fashion designers experimenting with 3D-printed bikinis , shoes , and dresses . [ 108 ] In commercial production Nike is using 3D printing to prototype and manufacture the 2012 Vapor Laser Talon football shoe for players of American football , and New Balance is 3D manufacturing custom-fit shoes for athletes . [ 108 ] [ 109 ] 3D printing has come to the point where companies are printing consumer grade eyewear with on-demand custom fit and styling ( although they can not print the lenses ) . On-demand customization of glasses is possible with rapid prototyping"
"Vanessa Friedman , fashion director and chief fashion critic at The New York Times , says 3D printing will have a significant value for fashion companies down the road , especially if it transforms into a print-it-yourself tool for shoppers . `` There 's real sense that this is not going to happen anytime soon , '' she says , `` but it will happen , and it will create dramatic change in how we think both about intellectual property and how things are in the supply chain . '' She adds : `` Certainly some of the fabrications that brands can use will be dramatically changed by technology . ''"
"In early 2014 , Swedish supercar manufacturer Koenigsegg announced the One:1 , a supercar that utilizes many components that were 3D printed . [ 112 ] Urbee is the name of the first car in the world car mounted using the technology 3D printing ( its bodywork and car windows were `` printed '' ) . [ 113 ] [ 114 ] [ 115 ]"
"In 2014 , Local Motors debuted Strati , a functioning vehicle that was entirely 3D Printed using ABS plastic and carbon fiber , except the powertrain . [ 116 ] In May 2015 Airbus announced that its new Airbus A350 XWB included over 1000 components manufactured by 3D printing . [ 117 ]"
"In 2015 , a Royal Air Force Eurofighter Typhoon fighter jet flew with printed parts . The United States Air Force has begun to work with 3D printers , and the Israeli Air Force has also purchased a 3D printer to print spare parts . [ 118 ]"
"In 2017 , GE Aviation revealed that it had used design for additive manufacturing to create a helicopter engine with 16 parts instead of 900 , with great potential impact on reducing the complexity of supply chains . [ 119 ]"
"AM 's impact on firearms involves two dimensions : new manufacturing methods for established companies , and new possibilities for the making of do-it-yourself firearms . In 2012 , the US-based group Defense Distributed disclosed plans to design a working plastic 3D printed firearm `` that could be downloaded and reproduced by anybody with a 3D printer . `` [ 120 ] [ 121 ] After Defense Distributed released their plans , questions were raised regarding the effects that 3D printing and widespread consumer-level CNC machining [ 122 ] [ 123 ] may have on gun control effectiveness ."
"Surgical uses of 3D printing-centric therapies have a history beginning in the mid-1990s with anatomical modeling for bony reconstructive surgery planning . Patient-matched implants were a natural extension of this work , leading to truly personalized implants that fit one unique individual . [ 128 ] Virtual planning of surgery and guidance using 3D printed , personalized instruments have been applied to many areas of surgery including total joint replacement and craniomaxillofacial reconstruction with great success . [ 129 ] One example of this is the bioresorbable trachial splint to treat newborns with tracheobronchomalacia [ 130 ] developed at the University of Michigan ."
The use of additive manufacturing for serialized production of orthopedic implants ( metals ) is also increasing due to the ability to efficiently create porous surface structures that facilitate osseointegration . The hearing aid and dental industries are expected to be the biggest area of future development using the custom 3D printing technology .
"In March 2014 , surgeons in Swansea used 3D printed parts to rebuild the face of a motorcyclist who had been seriously injured in a road accident . [ 132 ] In May 2018 , 3D printing has been used for the kidney transplant to save a three-year-old boy . [ 133 ] As of 2012 , 3D bio-printing technology has been studied by biotechnology firms and academia for possible use in tissue engineering applications in which organs and body parts are built using inkjet printing techniques . In this process , layers of living cells are deposited onto a gel medium or sugar matrix and slowly built up to form three-dimensional structures including vascular systems . [ 134 ] Recently , a heart-on-chip has been created which matches properties of cells"
"In 3D printing , computer-simulated microstructures are commonly used to fabricate objects with spatially varying properties . This is achieved by dividing the volume of the desired object into smaller subcells using computer aided simulation tools and then filling these cells with appropriate microstructures during fabrication . Several different candidate structures with similar behaviours are checked against each other and the object is fabricated when an optimal set of structures are found ."
Advanced topology optimization methods are used to ensure the compatibility of structures in adjacent cells . This flexible approach to 3D fabrication is widely used across various disciplines from biomedical sciences where they are used to create complex bone structures [ 136 ] and human tissue [ 137 ] to robotics where they are used in the creation of soft robots with movable parts . [ 138 ] [ 139 ] 3D printing also finds its uses more and more in design and fabrication of Laboratory apparatus
3D printing has also been employed by researchers in the pharmaceutical field . During the last few years there 's been a surge in academic interest regarding drug delivery with the aid of AM techniques . This technology offers a unique way for materials to be utilized in novel formulations
"AM manufacturing allows for the usage of materials and compounds in the development of formulations , in ways that are not possible with conventional/traditional techniques in the pharmaceutical field , e.g . tableting , cast-molding , etc . Moreover , one of the major advantages of 3D printing , especially in the case of Fused Deposition Modelling ( FDM ) , is the personalization of the dosage form that can be achieved , thus , targeting the patient 's specific needs . [ 142 ] In the not-so-distant future , 3D printers are expected to reach hospitals and pharmacies in order to provide on demand production of personalized formulations according to the patients ' needs"
"In 2018 , 3D printing technology was used for the first time to create a matrix for cell immobilization in fermentation . Propionic acid production by Propionibacterium acidipropionici immobilized on 3D-printed nylon beads was chosen as a model study . It was shown that those 3D-printed beads were capable of promoting high density cell attachment and propionic acid production , which could be adapted to other fermentation bioprocesses"
"In 2005 , academic journals had begun to report on the possible artistic applications of 3D printing technology . [ 145 ] As of 2017 , domestic 3D printing was reaching a consumer audience beyond hobbyists and enthusiasts . Off the shelf machines were increasingly capable of producing practical household applications , for example , ornamental objects . Some practical examples include a working clock [ 146 ] and gears printed for home woodworking machines among other purposes . [ 147 ] Web sites associated with home 3D printing tended to include backscratchers , coat hooks , door knobs , etc ."
"3D printing , and open source 3D printers in particular , are the latest technology making inroads into the classroom . [ 149 ] [ 150 ] [ 151 ] Some authors have claimed that 3D printers offer an unprecedented `` revolution '' in STEM education . [ 152 ] [ 153 ] The evidence for such claims comes from both the low-cost ability for rapid prototyping in the classroom by students , but also the fabrication of low-cost high-quality scientific equipment from open hardware designs forming open-source labs . [ 154 ] Future applications for 3D printing might include creating open-source scientific equipment"
"In the last several years 3D printing has been intensively used by in the cultural heritage field for preservation , restoration and dissemination purposes . [ 156 ] Many Europeans and North American Museums have purchased 3D printers and actively recreate missing pieces of their relics . [ 157 ] and archaeological monuments such as Tiwanaku in Bolivia . [ 158 ] The Metropolitan Museum of Art and the British Museum have started using their 3D printers to create museum souvenirs that are available in the museum shops ."
"Other museums , like the National Museum of Military History and Varna Historical Museum , have gone further and sell through the online platform Threeding digital models of their artifacts , created using Artec 3D scanners , in 3D printing friendly file format , which everyone can 3D print at home ."
"3D printed soft actuators is a growing application of 3D printing technology which has found its place in the 3D printing applications . These soft actuators are being developed to deal with soft structures and organs especially in biomedical sectors and where the interaction between human and robot is inevitable . The majority of the existing soft actuators are fabricated by conventional methods that require manual fabrication of devices , post processing/assembly , and lengthy iterations until maturity of the fabrication is achieved . Instead of the tedious and time-consuming aspects of the current fabrication processes , researchers are exploring an appropriate manufacturing approach for effective fabrication of soft actuators ."
"Thus , 3D printed soft actuators are introduced to revolutionise the design and fabrication of soft actuators with custom geometrical , functional , and control properties in a faster and inexpensive approach . They also enable incorporation of all actuator components into a single structure eliminating the need to use external joints , adhesives , and fasteners . Circuit board manufacturing involves multiple steps which include imaging , drilling , plating , soldermask coating , nomenclature printing and surface finishes . These steps include many chemicals such as harsh solvents and acids . 3D printing circuit boards remove the need for many of these steps while still producing complex designs ."
"Polymer ink is used to create the layers of the build while silver polymer is used for creating the traces and holes used to allow electricity to flow . [ 162 ] Current circuit board manufacturing can be a tedious process depending on the design . Specified materials are gathered and sent into inner layer processing where images are printed , developed and etched . The etches cores are typically punched to add lamination tooling . The cores are then prepared for lamination . The stack-up , the buildup of a circuit board , is built and sent into lamination where the layers are bonded . The boards are then measured and drilled . Many steps may differ from this stage however for simple designs , the material goes through a plating process to plate the holes and surface ."
"The outer image is then printed , developed and etched . After the image is defined , the material must get coated with soldermask for later soldering . Nomenclature is then added so components can be identified later . Then the surface finish is added . The boards are routed out of panel form into their singular or array form and then electrically tested . Aside from the paperwork which must be completed which proves the boards meet specifications , the boards are then packed and shipped . The benefits of 3D printing would be that the final outline is defined from the beginning , no imaging , punching or lamination is required and electrical connections are made with the silver polymer which eliminates drilling and plating . The final paperwork would also be greatly reduced due to the lack of materials required to build the circuit board . Complex designs which may takes weeks to complete through normal processing can be 3D printed , greatly reducing manufacturing time ."
"3D printing has existed for decades within certain manufacturing industries where many legal regimes , including patents , industrial design rights , copyrights , and trademarks may apply . However , there is not much jurisprudence to say how these laws will apply if 3D printers become mainstream and individuals or hobbyist communities begin manufacturing items for personal use , for non-profit distribution , or for sale"
"Any of the mentioned legal regimes may prohibit the distribution of the designs used in 3D printing , or the distribution or sale of the printed item . To be allowed to do these things , where an active intellectual property was involved , a person would have to contact the owner and ask for a licence , which may come with conditions and a price . However , many patent , design and copyright laws contain a standard limitation or exception for 'private ' , 'non-commercial ' use of inventions , designs or works of art protected under intellectual property ( IP ) . That standard limitation or exception may leave such private , non-commercial uses outside the scope of IP rights ."
"Patents cover inventions including processes , machines , manufacturing , and compositions of matter and have a finite duration which varies between countries , but generally 20 years from the date of application . Therefore , if a type of wheel is patented , printing , using , or selling such a wheel could be an infringement of the patent ."
"Copyright covers an expression [ 164 ] in a tangible , fixed medium and often lasts for the life of the author plus 70 years thereafter . [ 165 ] If someone makes a statue , they may have a copyright mark on the appearance of that statue , so if someone sees that statue , they can not then distribute designs to print an identical or similar statue ."
"When a feature has both artistic ( copyrightable ) and functional ( patentable ) merits , when the question has appeared in US court , the courts have often held the feature is not copyrightable unless it can be separated from the functional aspects of the item . [ 165 ] In other countries the law and the courts may apply a different approach allowing , for example , the design of a useful device to be registered ( as a whole ) as an industrial design on the understanding that , in case of unauthorized copying , only the non-functional features may be claimed under design law whereas any technical features could only be claimed if covered by a valid patent ."
"The US Department of Homeland Security and the Joint Regional Intelligence Center released a memo stating that `` significant advances in three-dimensional ( 3D ) printing capabilities , availability of free digital 3D printable files for firearms components , and difficulty regulating file sharing may present public safety risks from unqualified gun seekers who obtain or manufacture 3D printed guns '' and that `` proposed legislation to ban 3D printing of weapons may deter , but can not completely prevent , their production . Even if the practice is prohibited by new legislation , online distribution of these 3D printable files will be as difficult to control as any other illegally traded music , movie or software files . ''"
"Currently , it is not prohibited by law to manufacture firearms for personal use in the United States , as long as the firearm is not produced with the intent to be sold or transferred , and meets a few basic requirements . A license is required to manufacture firearms for sale or distribution . The law prohibits a person from assembling a non–sporting semiautomatic rifle or shotgun from 10 or more imported parts , as well as firearms that can not be detected by metal detectors or x–ray machines . In addition , the making of an NFA firearm requires a tax payment and advance approval by ATF ."
"Attempting to restrict the distribution of gun plans via the Internet has been likened to the futility of preventing the widespread distribution of DeCSS , which enabled DVD ripping . [ 168 ] [ 169 ] [ 170 ] [ 171 ] After the US government had Defense Distributed take down the plans , they were still widely available via the Pirate Bay and other file sharing sites . [ 172 ] Downloads of the plans from the UK , Germany , Spain , and Brazil were heavy ."
"Some US legislators have proposed regulations on 3D printers to prevent them from being used for printing guns . [ 175 ] [ 176 ] 3D printing advocates have suggested that such regulations would be futile , could cripple the 3D printing industry , and could infringe on free speech rights , with early pioneer of 3D printing Professor Hod Lipson suggesting that gunpowder could be controlled instead"
"Internationally , where gun controls are generally stricter than in the United States , some commentators have said the impact may be more strongly felt since alternative firearms are not as easily obtainable . [ 183 ] Officials in the United Kingdom have noted that producing a 3D printed gun would be illegal under their gun control laws . [ 184 ] Europol stated that criminals have access to other sources of weapons but noted that as technology improves , the risks of an effect would increase ."
"In the United States , the FAA has anticipated a desire to use additive manufacturing techniques and has been considering how best to regulate this process . [ 187 ] The FAA has jurisdiction over such fabrication because all aircraft parts must be made under FAA production approval or under other FAA regulatory categories . [ 188 ] In December 2016 , the FAA approved the production of a 3D printed fuel nozzle for the GE LEAP engine ."
"Aviation attorney Jason Dickstein has suggested that additive manufacturing is merely a production method , and should be regulated like any other production method . [ 190 ] [ 191 ] He has suggested that the FAA 's focus should be on guidance to explain compliance , rather than on changing the existing rules , and that existing regulations and guidance permit a company `` to develop a robust quality system that adequately reflects regulatory needs for quality assurance . ''"
"Research on the health and safety concerns of 3D printing is new and in development due to the recent proliferation of 3D printing devices . In 2017 , the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work has published a discussion paper on the processes and materials involved in 3D printing , potential implications of this technology for occupational safety and health and avenues for controlling potential hazards ."
"Emissions from fused filament printers can include a large number of ultrafine particles and volatile organic compounds ( VOCs ) . [ 193 ] [ 194 ] [ 195 ] The toxicity from emissions varies by source material due to differences in size , chemical properties , and quantity of emitted particles . [ 193 ] Excessive exposure to VOCs can lead to irritation of the eyes , nose , and throat , headache , loss of coordination , and nausea and some of the chemical emissions of fused filament printers have also been linked to asthma ."
"Based on animal studies , carbon nanotubes and carbon nanofibers sometimes used in fused filament printing can cause pulmonary effects including inflammation , granulomas , and pulmonary fibrosis when at the nanoparticle size . [ 197 ] A National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ( NIOSH ) study noted particle emissions from a fused filament peaked a few minutes after printing started and returned to baseline levels 100 minutes after printing ended . [ 193 ] Workers may also inadvertently transport materials outside the workplace on their shoes , garments , and body , which may pose hazards for other members of the public ."
"Laser sintering and laser beam melting systems for additive manufacturing have become more important recently . The Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ( IFA ) together with German social accident insurance institutions conducted a measurement programme on inhalation exposure to hazardous substances during laser deposition welding and laser beam melting with alloyed steels and nickel- , aluminium- and titanium-based alloys . No chromium ( VI ) compounds were detected in the workplace air during the process when materials containing chromium were processed , and the assessment criteria were complied with during processes with the other metal powders ."
"One reason for this is that the machines are usually operated with encapsulation or dust extraction in order to achieve the required product quality . Since many work steps before and after the process including the handling of powder or powdered parts are performed manually or semi-automatically , there are huge effects on the degree of inhalation exposure and the measured values vary broadly . It is therefore difficult to derive tailored measures for these processes ."
Carbon nanoparticle emissions and processes using powder metals are highly combustible and raise the risk of dust explosions . [ 200 ] At least one case of severe injury was noted from an explosion involved in metal powders used for fused filament printing .
"Additional hazards include burns from hot surfaces such as lamps and print head blocks , exposure to laser or ultraviolet radiation , electrical shock , mechanical injury from being struck by moving parts , and noise and ergonomic hazards . [ 202 ] [ 203 ] Other concerns involve gas and material exposures , in particular nanomaterials , material handling , static electricity , moving parts and pressures ."
"Hazards to health and safety also exist from post-processing activities done to finish parts after they have been printed . These post-processing activities can include chemical baths , sanding , polishing , or vapor exposure to refine surface finish , as well as general subtractive manufacturing techniques such as drilling , milling , or turning to modify the printed geometry . [ 205 ] Any technique that removes material from the printed part has the potential to generate particles that can be inhaled or cause eye injury if proper personal protective equipment is not used , such as respirators or safety glasses . Caustic baths are often used to dissolve support material used by some 3D printers that allows them to print more complex shapes . These baths require personal protective equipment to prevent injury to exposed skin ."
"Since 3-D imaging creates items by fusing materials together , there runs the risk of layer separation in some devices made using 3-D Imaging . For example , in January 2013 , the US medical device company , DePuy , recalled their knee and hip replacement systems . The devices were made from layers of metal , and shavings had come loose – potentially harming the patient ."
"Hazard controls include using manufacturer-supplied covers and full enclosures , using proper ventilation , keeping workers away from the printer , using respirators , turning off the printer if it jammed , and using lower emission printers and filaments . Personal protective equipment has been found to be the least desirable control method with a recommendation that it only be used to add further protection in combination with approved emissions protection ."
"Although no occupational exposure limits specific to 3D printer emissions exist , certain source materials used in 3D printing , such as carbon nanofiber and carbon nanotubes , have established occupational exposure limits at the nanoparticle size . [ 193 ] [ 207 ]"
"As of March 2018 , the US Government has set 3D printer emission standards for only a limited number of compounds . Furthermore , the few established standards address factory conditions , not home or other environments in which the printers are likely to be used ."
"Additive manufacturing , starting with today 's infancy period , requires manufacturing firms to be flexible , ever-improving users of all available technologies to remain competitive . Advocates of additive manufacturing also predict that this arc of technological development will counter globalization , as end users will do much of their own manufacturing rather than engage in trade to buy products from other people and corporations . [ 10 ] The real integration of the newer additive technologies into commercial production , however , is more a matter of complementing traditional subtractive methods rather than displacing them entirely ."
"The futurologist Jeremy Rifkin [ 210 ] claimed that 3D printing signals the beginning of a third industrial revolution , [ 211 ] succeeding the production line assembly that dominated manufacturing starting in the late 19th century ."
"Since the 1950s , a number of writers and social commentators have speculated in some depth about the social and cultural changes that might result from the advent of commercially affordable additive manufacturing technology . [ 212 ] In recent years , 3D printing is creating significant impact in the humanitarian and development sector . Its potential to facilitate distributed manufacturing is resulting in supply chain and logistics benefits , by reducing the need for transportation , warehousing and wastage . Furthermore , social and economic development is being advanced through the creation of local production economies ."
"Others have suggested that as more and more 3D printers start to enter people 's homes , the conventional relationship between the home and the workplace might get further eroded . [ 213 ] Likewise , it has also been suggested that , as it becomes easier for businesses to transmit designs for new objects around the globe , so the need for high-speed freight services might also become less . [ 214 ] Finally , given the ease with which certain objects can now be replicated , it remains to be seen whether changes will be made to current copyright legislation so as to protect intellectual property rights with the new technology widely available ."
"As 3D printers became more accessible to consumers , online social platforms have developed to support the community . [ 215 ] This includes websites that allow users to access information such as how to build a 3D printer , as well as social forums that discuss how to improve 3D print quality and discuss 3D printing news , as well as social media websites that are dedicated to share 3D models ."
"RepRap is a wiki based website that was created to hold all information on 3d printing , and has developed into a community that aims to bring 3D printing to everyone . Furthermore , there are other sites such as Pinshape , Thingiverse and MyMiniFactory , which were created initially to allow users to post 3D files for anyone to print , allowing for decreased transaction cost of sharing 3D files . These websites have allowed greater social interaction between users , creating communities dedicated to 3D printing ."
"Some call attention to the conjunction of Commons-based peer production with 3D printing and other low-cost manufacturing techniques . [ 219 ] [ 220 ] [ 221 ] The self-reinforced fantasy of a system of eternal growth can be overcome with the development of economies of scope , and here , society can play an important role contributing to the raising of the whole productive structure to a higher plateau of more sustainable and customized productivity"
"Further , it is true that many issues , problems , and threats arise due to the democratization of the means of production , and especially regarding the physical ones . [ 219 ] For instance , the recyclability of advanced nanomaterials is still questioned ; weapons manufacturing could become easier ; not to mention the implications for counterfeiting [ 222 ] and on intellectual property . [ 223 ] It might be maintained that in contrast to the industrial paradigm whose competitive dynamics were about economies of scale , Commons-based peer production 3D printing could develop economies of scope . While the advantages of scale rest on cheap global transportation , the economies of scope share infrastructure costs ( intangible and tangible productive resources ) , taking advantage of the capabilities of the fabrication tools ."
"And following Neil Gershenfeld [ 224 ] in that `` some of the least developed parts of the world need some of the most advanced technologies , '' Commons-based peer production and 3D printing may offer the necessary tools for thinking globally but acting locally in response to certain needs ."
"Larry Summers wrote about the `` devastating consequences '' of 3D printing and other technologies ( robots , artificial intelligence , etc . ) for those who perform routine tasks . In his view , `` already there are more American men on disability insurance than doing production work in manufacturing . And the trends are all in the wrong direction , particularly for the less skilled , as the capacity of capital embodying artificial intelligence to replace white-collar as well as blue-collar work will increase rapidly in the years ahead . ''"
"Summers recommends more vigorous cooperative efforts to address the `` myriad devices '' ( e.g. , tax havens , bank secrecy , money laundering , and regulatory arbitrage ) enabling the holders of great wealth to `` a paying '' income and estate taxes , and to make it more difficult to accumulate great fortunes without requiring `` great social contributions '' in return , including : more vigorous enforcement of anti-monopoly laws , reductions in `` excessive '' protection for intellectual property , greater encouragement of profit-sharing schemes that may benefit workers and give them a stake in wealth accumulation , strengthening of collective bargaining arrangements , improvements in corporate governance , strengthening of financial regulation to eliminate subsidies to financial activity , easing of land-use restrictions that may cause the real estate of the rich to keep rising in value , better training for young people and retraining for displaced workers , and increased public and private investment in infrastructure development—e.g. , in energy production and transportation ."
"Michael Spence wrote that `` Now comes a ... powerful , wave of digital technology that is replacing labor in increasingly complex tasks . This process of labor substitution and disintermediation has been underway for some time in service sectors—think of ATMs , online banking , enterprise resource planning , customer relationship management , mobile payment systems , and much more . This revolution is spreading to the production of goods , where robots and 3D printing are displacing labor . '' In his view , the vast majority of the cost of digital technologies comes at the start , in the design of hardware ( e.g . 3D printers ) and , more important , in creating the software that enables machines to carry out various tasks . `` Once this is achieved , the marginal cost of the hardware is relatively low ( and declines as scale rises ) , and the marginal cost of replicating the software is essentially zero ."
"Spence believes that , unlike prior digital technologies , which drove firms to deploy underutilized pools of valuable labor around the world , the motivating force in the current wave of digital technologies `` is cost reduction via the replacement of labor . '' For example , as the cost of 3D printing technology declines , it is `` easy to imagine '' that production may become `` extremely '' local and customized . Moreover , production may occur in response to actual demand , not anticipated or forecast demand . Spence believes that labor , no matter how inexpensive , will become a less important asset for growth and employment expansion , with labor-intensive , process-oriented manufacturing becoming less effective , and that re-localization will appear in both developed and developing countries . In his view , production will not disappear , but it will be less labor-intensive , and all countries will eventually need to rebuild their growth models around digital technologies and the human capital supporting their deployment and expansion ."
"Naomi Wu regards the usage of 3D printing in the Chinese classroom ( where rote memorization is standard ) to teach design principles and creativity as the most exciting recent development of the technology , and more generally regards 3D printing as being the next desktop publishing revolution"
"The growth of additive manufacturing could have a large impact on the environment . As opposed to traditional manufacturing , for instance , in which pieces are cut from larger blocks of material , additive manufacturing creates products layer-by-layer and prints only relevant parts , wasting much less material and thus wasting less energy in producing the raw materials needed . [ 228 ] By making only the bare structural necessities of products , additive manufacturing also could make a profound contribution to lightweighting , reducing the energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions of vehicles and other forms of transportation ."
"A case study on an airplane component made using additive manufacturing , for example , found that the component 's use saves 63 % of relevant energy and carbon dioxide emissions over the course of the product 's lifetime . [ 230 ] In addition , previous life-cycle assessment of additive manufacturing has estimated that adopting the technology could further lower carbon dioxide emissions since 3D printing creates localized production , and products would not need to be transported long distances to reach their final destination ."
"Continuing to adopt additive manufacturing does pose some environmental downsides , however . Despite additive manufacturing reducing waste from the subtractive manufacturing process by up to 90 % , the additive manufacturing process creates other forms of waste such as non-recyclable material powders . Additive manufacturing has not yet reached its theoretical material efficiency potential of 97 % , but it may get closer as the technology continues to increase productivity"
Some large FDM printers which melt High-density polyethylene ( HDPE ) pellets may also accept sufficiently clean recycled material such as chipped milk bottles . In addition these printers can use shredded material coming from faulty builds or unsuccessful prototype versions thus reducing overall project wastage and materials handling and storage .
Semtech and Smart Mimic Secure Rooms and Belongings with LoRa®-based Consumer Devices
"The MimicGO sensor offers instant , portable and secure deployment , while providing real-time status updates on asset location or room tampering ."
"Semtech Corporation announced that Smart Mimic , a leading provider of Internet of Things ( IoT ) solutions for security on-the-go , has integrated Semtech ’ s LoRa® devices and the LoRaWAN® protocol into its new MimicGO line of consumer products for enabling safe and secure rooms and belongings ."
"The LoRa-based devices deploy indoor or outdoor to monitor condition changes in a range of applications , including door sensing , belonging movements and tampering , motion sensing in rooms , and open/closed status in drawers or safes ."
"“ Semtech ’ s LoRa devices and the LoRaWAN protocol connect flexible consumer security devices for smarter management and deliver the ideal combination of low power and consistent data monitoring required for the MimicGO product line , ” said Burak Yalcinkaya , Co-founder and Head of Marketing at Smart Mimic ."

"Atom-thin transistor uses half the voltage of common semiconductors , boosts current density"
"University at Buffalo researchers are reporting a new , two-dimensional transistor made of graphene and the compound molybdenum disulfide that could help usher in a new era of computing ."
"As described in a paper accepted at the 2020 IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting , which is taking place virtually next week , the transistor requires half the voltage of current semiconductors . It also has a current density greater than similar transistors under development ."
"This ability to operate with less voltage and handle more current is key to meet the demand for new power-hungry nanoelectronic devices , including quantum computers ."
"New technologies are needed to extend the performance of electronic systems in terms of power , speed , and density . This next-generation transistor can rapidly switch while consuming low amounts of energy , says the paper 's lead author , Huamin Li , Ph.D. , assistant professor of electrical engineering in the UB School of Engineering and Applied Sciences ( SEAS ) ."
"The transistor is composed of a single layer of graphene and a single layer of molybdenum disulfide , or MoS2 , which is a part of a group of compounds known as transition metals chalcogenides . The graphene and MoS2 are stacked together , and the overall thickness of the device is roughly 1 nanometer—for comparison , a sheet of paper is about 100,000 nanometers ."
"While most transistors require 60 millivolts for a decade of change in current , this new device operates at 29 millivolts ."
"It 's able to do this because the unique physical properties of graphene keep electrons `` cold '' as they are injected from the graphene into the MoS2 channel . This process is called Dirac-source injection . The electrons are considered `` cold '' because they require much less voltage input and , thus , reduced power consumption to operate the transistor ."
"An even more important characteristic of the transistor , Li says , is its ability to handle a greater current density compared to conventional transistor technologies based on 2-D or 3-D channel materials . As described in the study , the transistor can handle 4 microamps per micrometer ."
"The transistor illustrates the enormous potential 2-D semiconductors and their ability to usher in energy-efficient nanoelectronic devices . This could ultimately lead to advancements in quantum research and development , and help extend Moore 's Law , says co-lead author Fei Yao , Ph.D. , assistant professor in the Department of Materials Design and Innovation , a joint program of SEAS and UB 's College of Arts of Sciences ."
Applying particle physics methods to quantum computing
"Borrowing a page from high-energy physics and astronomy textbooks , a team of physicists and computer scientists at the U.S. Department of Energy 's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory ( Berkeley Lab ) has successfully adapted and applied a common error-reduction technique to the field of quantum computing ."
"In the world of subatomic particles and giant particle detectors , and distant galaxies and giant telescopes , scientists have learned to live , and to work , with uncertainty . They are often trying to tease out ultra-rare particle interactions from a massive tangle of other particle interactions and background `` noise '' that can complicate their hunt , or trying to filter out the effects of atmospheric distortions and interstellar dust to improve the resolution of astronomical imaging ."
"Also , inherent problems with detectors , such as with their ability to record all particle interactions or to exactly measure particles ' energies , can result in data getting misread by the electronics they are connected to , so scientists need to design complex filters , in the form of computer algorithms , to reduce the margin of error and return the most accurate results ."
"The problems of noise and physical defects , and the need for error-correction and error-mitigation algorithms , which reduce the frequency and severity of errors , are also common in the fledgling field of quantum computing , and a study published in the journal npj Quantum Information found that there appear to be some common solutions , too ."
"Ben Nachman , a Berkeley Lab physicist who is involved with particle physics experiments at CERN as a member of Berkeley Lab 's ATLAS group , saw the quantum-computing connection while working on a particle physics calculation with Christian Bauer , a Berkeley Lab theoretical physicist who is a co-author of the study . ATLAS is one of the four giant particle detectors at CERN 's Large Hadron Collider , the largest and most powerful particle collider in the world ."
"At ATLAS , we often have to 'unfold , ' or correct for detector effects , said Nachman , the study 's lead author . `` People have been developing this technique for years . ''"
"In experiments at the LHC , particles called protons collide at a rate of about 1 billion times per second . To cope with this incredibly busy , `` noisy '' environment and intrinsic problems related to the energy resolution and other factors associated with detectors , physicists use error-correcting `` unfolding '' techniques and other filters to winnow down this particle jumble to the most useful , accurate data ."
New Ways to Store Energy : Electrochemical Technologies Can Help Reduce Reliance on Fossil Fuels
"Fikile Brushett , an MIT associate professor of chemical engineering , had an unusual source of inspiration for his career in the chemical sciences : the character played by Nicolas Cage in the 1996 movie “ The Rock. ” In the film , Cage portrays an FBI chemist who hunts down a group of rogue U.S. soldiers who have commandeered chemical weapons and taken over the island of Alcatraz ."
"“ For a really long time , I really wanted to be a chemist and work for the FBI with chemical warfare agents . That was the goal : to be Nick Cage , ” recalls Brushett , who first saw the movie as a high school student living in Silver Spring , Maryland , a suburb of Washington ."
"Though he did not end up joining the FBI or working with chemical weapons — which he says is probably for the best — Brushett did pursue his love of chemistry . In his lab at MIT , Brushett leads a group dedicated to developing more efficient and sustainable ways to store energy , including batteries that could be used to store the electricity generated by wind and solar power . He is also exploring new ways to convert carbon dioxide to useful fuels ."
"“ The backbone of our global energy economy is based upon liquid fossil fuels right now , and energy demand is increasing , ” he says . “ The challenge we ’ re facing is that carbon emissions are tied very tightly to this increasing energy demand , and carbon emissions are linked to climate volatility , as well as pollution and health effects . To me , this is an incredibly urgent , important , and inspiring problem to go after . ”"
"Brushett ’ s parents immigrated to the United States in the early 1980s , before he was born . His mother , an English as a second language teacher , is from South Africa , and his father , an economist , is from the United Kingdom . Brushett grew up mostly in the Washington area , with the exception of four years spent living in Zimbabwe , due to his father ’ s work at the World Bank ."
"Brushett remembers this as an idyllic time , saying , “ School ended at 1 p.m. , so you almost had the whole afternoon to do sports at school , or you could go home and just play in the garden . ”"
"His family returned to the Washington area while he was in sixth grade , and in high school , he started to get interested in chemistry , as well as other scientific subjects and math ."
"At the University of Pennsylvania , he decided to major in chemical engineering because someone had advised him that if he liked chemistry and math , chemical engineering would be a good fit . While he enjoyed some of his chemical engineering classes , he struggled with others at first ."
"“ I remember really having a hard time with chemE for a while , and I was fortunate enough to have a really good academic advisor who said , ‘ Listen , chemE is hard for some people . Some people get it immediately , for some people it takes a little while for it to sink in , ’ ” he says . Around his junior year , concepts started to fall into place , he recalls . “ Rather than looking at courses as self-contained units , the units started coming together and flowing into a body of knowledge . I was able to see the interconnections between courses . ”"
"While he was originally most interested in molecular biotechnology — the field of engineering proteins and other biological molecules — he ended up working in a reaction engineering lab with his academic advisor , John Vohs . There , he studied how catalytic surfaces influence chemical reactions . At Vohs ’ recommendation , he applied to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign for graduate school , where he worked on electrochemistry projects . With his PhD advisor , Paul Kenis , he developed microfluidic fuel cells that could run on a variety of different fuels as portable power sources ."
"During his third year of graduate school , he began applying for faculty positions and was offered a job at MIT , which he accepted but deferred for two years so he could do a postdoc at Argonne National Laboratory . There , he worked with scientists and engineers doing a wide range of research on electrochemical energy storage , and became interested in flow batteries , which is now one of the major focus areas of his lab at MIT ."
"Unlike the rechargeable lithium-ion batteries that power our cell phones and laptops , flow batteries use large tanks of liquid to store energy . Such batteries have traditionally been prohibitively expensive because they rely on pricey electroactive metal salts . Brushett is working on alternative approaches that use less expensive electroactive materials derived from organic compounds ."
"Such batteries could be used to store the power intermittently produced by wind turbines and solar panels , making them a more reliable , efficient , and cost-effective source of energy . His lab also works on new processes for converting carbon dioxide , a waste product and greenhouse gas , into useful fuels ."
"In a related area of research , Brushett ’ s lab performs “ techno-economic ” modeling of potential new technologies , to help them assess what aspects of the technology need the most improvement to make them economically feasible ."
"“ With techno-economic modeling , we can devise targets for basic science , ” he says . “ We ’ re always looking for the rate-limiting step . What is it that ’ s preventing us from moving forward ? In some cases it could be a catalyst , in other cases it could be a membrane . In other cases it could be the architecture for the device . ”"
"Once those targets are identified , researchers working in those areas have a better idea of what they need to focus on to make a particular technology work , Brushett says ."
"“ That ’ s the thing I ’ ve been most proud of from our research — hopefully opening up or demystifying the field and allowing a more diverse set of researchers to enter and to add value , which I think is important in terms of growing the science and developing new ideas , ” he says ."

Funding energy efficiency on the blockchain
"Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak has launched Efforce , a blockchain-based energy efficiency crowdfunding platform ."
"Efforce , styled as “ the first blockchain-based energy saving platform ” , is designed to enable contributors to support energy efficiency projects by investing in tokenised future savings . These funds are delivered to companies to support energy efficiency projects with the resultant savings written on the blockchain from where they are redistributed to the investors ."
"The model draws on the crowdfunding model popular in the early days of blockchain and the traditional ESCO model for funding energy efficiency projects in which returns on investment accrue through energy performance contracts , i.e . the savings the energy efficiency improvements deliver ."
"Energy efficiency has considerable potential in the future energy system . In 2019 the market reached $ 250 billion , according to the International Energy Agency ( IEA ) ."
"While there has been a slowdown in the current year , growth will continue . The IEA has projected energy efficiency to deliver almost half of the reduction in energy-related greenhouse gas emissions over the next 20 years in its scenario targeting full achievement of the international climate and energy goals ."
"Energy efficiency upgrades can readily run into the millions of dollars . But the main challenges occur for the smaller amounts of hundreds of thousands of dollars , which are the requirement of many SMEs but outside the scope of the higher value investment funds ."
"Efforce says in its white paper , that the intention is to make investment in energy efficiency “ fluid and accessible ” , overcoming factors such as a typical minimum investment requirement of $ 250,000 and lack of technical knowledge on energy systems or funding uncertainties ."
"Efforce has apparently been some years in the making and has evolved out of the Milan-headquartered ESCO , AitherCO2 , founded in 2010 by Efforce co-founder and Project Lead , Jacopo Visetti ."
"The white paper cites two of the first projects to be implemented on the platform , which are carried over from AitherCO2 . One is an energy efficiency project on a dual 8.55MW industrial tri-generation plant located in Italy , with a total cost of €6.5 million offering an annual IRR of 20 % for 7 years ."
"The second is an energy redevelopment project for a hotel complex located on the French Riviera costing €1.35 million , with an annual IRR of 15 % for 5 years ."
"According to Efforce , the first energy efficiency project is due to be completed in Q2 of 2021 when sharing of efficiency savings will start .

"Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 5G deep dive — New flagship SoC promises significant improvements in camera , gaming , and AI"
"Just in time for the year 's finale , Qualcomm is presenting its new top chip that will drive the top phones of the coming year 2021 to peak performance . An integrated 5G modem along with more powerful cameras , CPU , GPU , and especially AI give manufacturers new leeway in developing new functionality for next gen devices . Here is a comprehensive overview of all new features of the new cell phone chip that is slated to power flagship smartphones in 2021 ."
"It has now been about a year since the US semiconductor manufacturer launched its last high-end chip , the Snapdragon 865 . With the brand-new Snapdragon 888 , Qualcomm breaks with its previous name for the first time ( 865 , 855 , 845 , ... ) . The 8 in the model name , which identified the chip as a representative of the highest performance class , is now tripled to make the new chip an over-premium SoC ."
"With the step from a 7 to a 5 nm process , production-related performance increases in the double-digit percentage range can be expected and the energy efficiency of the chip should also improve in the double-digit range . In addition , Qualcomm promises numerous improvements , particularly in the camera and AI capabilities of the new chip ."
The first smartphones based on the new Snapdragon 888 SoC are expected to be on the market as early as the first quarter of 2021 .
"While the Snapdragon 865 still had to rely on a provided 5G modem , Qualcomm integrated the new X60 modem RF system into the chip . The modem was introduced in early 2020 and , like the entire 888 chip , is based on 5 nm manufacturing technology . With the X60 modem , the Qualcomm FastConnect 6900 system is also incorporated into the new chip that provides WiFi 6 and WiFi 6E ( 6 GHz ) and Bluetooth 5.2 functionality ."
"For image processing , Qualcomm 's new Snapdragon 888 uses the Spectra 580 CV-ISP , the world 's first triple image processor . In the future , three camera modules can be processed simultaneously , giving users completely new options for image and video recording , post-processing , and editing ."
"In terms of the graphics processor , the Qualcomm Adreno 660 GPU replaces the Adreno 650 in the predecessor and is expected to enable around 35 % faster image rendering with an efficiency increase of around 20 % . For AI applications , the Hexagon 780 computing unit is available , which , by merging the Scalar , Tensor and Vector computing units , experiences a tremendous acceleration in terms of internal data exchange . Compared to its predecessor , Qualcomm also wants to have improved the performance per watt by a factor of 3x ."
"Improvements also include the Qualcomm Sensing Hub , the Qualcomm Security Processor ( isolated OS for individual apps , instant switch between isolated systems ) and the Kryo 680 CPU Unit . The basic structure of the Kryo 680 CPU — one 2.84 GHz prime core ( Cortex X1 ) , three 2.4 GHz performance cores ( Cortex-A78 ) and four 1.8 GHz efficiency cores ( Cortex-A55 ) — is similar to its predecessor , the Kryo 585 , but based on a new architecture . Overall , the CPU should achieve a performance increase of 25 % and an increase in efficiency of 25 % compared to its predecessor ."
"The Qualcomm AI engine , i.e . the combination of the Adreno GPU , Hexagon processor , the Sensing Hub and the Kryo CPU , is now expected to achieve up to 26 TOPS . Compared to the predecessor SD 865 , this is almost double the performance ( 15 TOPS ) ."
Qualcomm does not yet provide information about the TDP of the chip or the chip size ( with the integrated X60 modem )
Imaging — Spectra 580 triple ISP controls three camera modules in parallel
"Qualcomm counts the triple ISP Spectra 580 among the most important features of the new Snapdragon 888 SoC . This makes it possible to process the image or video data of three camera modules ( 3x 4K HDR or 3x 28 megapixels ) in parallel , such as the main camera , an additional wide-angle camera and a further lens with zoom . Thanks to the parallel data processing , the change from one camera module to another ( zoom ) , for example , is practically seamless ."
"Qualcomm states a data rate of 2.7 gigapixels per second that the new Spectre 580 ISP achieves , an improvement of 35 % over its predecessor Spectra 480 ( 2 gigapixels ) ."
"Thanks to this enormous data rate , it will also be possible for the first time to capture up to 120 images per second at maximum resolution . Qualcomm also wants to have significantly improved the low-light performance . It should now be possible to take pictures even at only 0.1 lux , which is about the brightness of a full moon night ."
"Qualcomm 's Spectra 590 ISP will also support upcoming `` Staggered HDR '' image sensors . Put simply , final images are composed of three individual images with different exposure , with the aim of achieving a particularly wide color dynamic range . This technique can be used for both images and videos ( 4K with `` computational '' HDR ) . In addition , the Spectra 590 ISP also allows the capture of 10-bit photos in HEIF format ."
"AI is also set to play an even more important role in the high-end smartphone cameras of the future . Qualcomm mentions AI-based autofocus , auto exposure or automatic white balance . For this , image content must first be recognized by AI in order to be able to make the necessary adjustments automatically within fractions of a second before the image is captured ."
Mobile gaming - Variable Rate Shading frees-up resources for developers
"Qualcomm also promises to make some improvements in the area of mobile gaming . The new Adreno 660 GPU is said to have made no less than the biggest leap in its development history to date — 35 % more performance with 20 % improved efficiency compared to its predecessor , the Adreno 650 ."
"Game Quick Touch is said to significantly improve the response time for touch input . The advantage over previous solutions should be around 20 % at 60 Fps , around 15 % at 90 Fps and around 10 % at 120 Fps ."
"Variable Rate Shading presents itself as exciting for developers . The principle is based on rendering areas with lower detail levels , which are secondary to the game action , with a lower resolution . Here , too , AI plays an essential role in the recognition of image content . With Variable Rate Shading , it should be possible to save up to 30 % in performance resources , which , according to Qualcomm , can be used by developers for more complex content ."
"AI - Significantly more performance , better efficiency and always-on AI functions"
"Qualcomm 's previous chips already highlighted the importance of AI functionality for current and future smartphone hardware . Qualcomm 's current Snapdragon 888 SoC now integrates the 6th generation Qualcomm AI engine . The heart of all AI functions is the Hexagon 780 processor , which now merges the Tensor , Vector and Scalar calculation units . Special applications that depend on the exchange of data between the cores should thus benefit from the throughput accelerated by a factor of 1000x ."
Qualcomm also seems to have improved the calculation units themselves . For example the scalar cores offer up to 50 % more performance and the tensor cores now have twice the calculation capacity compared to their predecessor . All improvements together are slated to highly benefit the efficiency of the Hexagon processor ; Qualcomm mentions up to three times the performance of the predecessor per watt of energy consumption .
"The Qualcomm Sensing Hub now integrates a special low-power AI processor , which is specially designed to handle always-on tasks and can thus relieve some of the Hexagon processor 's burden . Qualcomm sees possible application scenarios such as background noise detection , general activity detection , accident detection , earthquake detection , etc . Qualcomm AI Engine direct also provides a common interface ( API ) for developers to get the most out of the AI capabilities of the Snapdragon 888 ."

But whether this upheaval ultimately helps or hinders efforts to accelerate clean energy transitions and reach international energy and climate goals will depend on how governments respond to today ’ s challenges ."
Energy efficiency ’ s weakest progress in a decade threatens international climate goals
"The already sluggish pace of global progress on energy efficiency is set to slow further this year as a result of the economic impacts of the Covid-19 crisis , deepening the challenge of reaching international energy and climate goals and making stronger government action critical"
Reaching energy and climate goals demands a dramatic scaling up of clean energy technologies – starting now
"A major effort to develop and deploy clean energy technologies worldwide is urgently needed to meet international energy and climate goals , particularly in order to reduce carbon emissions from areas beyond the power sector such as transport , buildings and industry"

BWXT AND OAK RIDGE ANNOUNCE DEVELOPMENTS IN 3D PRINTED NUCLEAR REACTOR COMPONENTS
"Leading nuclear and fuel component supplier BWX Technologies ( BWXT ) , together with Oak Ridge National Laboratory , has announced advancements in the development of a new additive manufacturing technology specifically for the production of reactor components ."
"The process now works with both high-temperature alloys and refractory metals , which are crucial for the safe operation of advanced nuclear reactors . By providing a method of 3D printing such components , the idea is that they can be rapidly deployed with all of the environmental and design benefits of additive manufacturing ."
"Ken Camplin , President of the Nuclear Services Group at BWXT , states : “ We have a uniquely talented group of engineers and designers at BWXT . Their work will make it far easier for advanced reactor developers to move forward in dealing with a number of critical technical challenges inherent in many of these designs . ”"
"BWXT believes 3D printing has the potential to be “ transformational for the industry ” , as it enables engineers to design components without worrying about the geometric constraints of conventional manufacturing . The partners have recently demonstrated the technology ’ s capability in 3D printing nickel-based super alloys and refractory metal-based alloys , while achieving component-level qualification of complex geometries ."
"The company originally validated the technology itself back in 2018 , when it successfully took part in a U.S. Department of Energy advanced nuclear technology development cost-share program . Now , the verified materials and parts serve as a tangible marker of the technological advancements over the past two years , paving the way for components that deliver improved thermal properties , increased safety margins , and accident-tolerant qualities ."
"According to BWXT , the use of refractory metal core components can help achieve core exit temperatures of 2700°F , or 1482°C , and overall plant efficiencies of an impressive 50 % . The company has also stated that the recent material developments can indeed have an immediate impact on the country ’ s current active reactor fleet with accident-tolerant component redesigns ."
"There are also cost benefits to the new technology . By improving the power output and longevity of the individual parts , the system as a whole will require less in terms of maintenance and repair . The prototyping process should also be more cost-effective with design iterations being made on the fly without too great a commitment ."
"The details of how the technology can also reduce manufacturing risk were recently outlined in a proposal to the Department of Energy ’ s Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program ( ARDP ) . In the words of the Department of Energy , the ARDP will reportedly “ speed the demonstration of advanced reactors through cost-shared partnerships with U.S. industry . By rapidly developing these advanced reactors that hold so much promise , we can expand access to clean energy and take advantage of market opportunities before key infrastructure and supply chain capabilities are lost . ”"
"As part of its Transformational Challenge Reactor ( TCR ) Demonstration Program , Oak Ridge also announced the development of 3D printed nuclear reactor core using DED technology earlier this year . The lab has already refined the microreactor design , and has established qualification methods to confirm the consistency and reliability of the 3D printed components ."
"Additionally , Purdue University recently received an $ 800,000 grant from the Department of Energy to take part as a key contributor in the TCR . Purdue ’ s engineers , specifically , will be involved in the development of a novel artificial intelligence model to ensure nuclear-grade quality of the microreactor ’ s critical components ."

"Smartdust [ 1 ] is a system of many tiny microelectromechanical systems ( MEMS ) such as sensors , robots , or other devices , that can detect , for example , light , temperature , vibration , magnetism , or chemicals . They are usually operated on a computer network wirelessly and are distributed over some area to perform tasks , usually sensing through radio-frequency identification . Without an antenna of much greater size the range of tiny smart dust communication devices is measured in a few millimeters and they may be vulnerable to electromagnetic disablement and destruction by microwave exposure ."
"The concepts for Smart Dust emerged from a workshop at RAND in 1992 and a series of DARPA ISAT studies in the mid-1990s due to the potential military applications of the technology . [ 2 ] The work was strongly influenced by work at UCLA and the University of Michigan during that period , as well as science fiction authors Stanislaw Lem ( in novels The Invincible in 1964 and Peace on Earth in 1985 ) , Neal Stephenson and Vernor Vinge . The first public presentation of the concept by that name was at the American Vacuum Society meeting in Anaheim in 1996 ."
"A Smart Dust research proposal [ 3 ] was presented to DARPA written by Kristofer S. J. Pister , Joe Kahn , and Bernhard Boser , all from the University of California , Berkeley , in 1997 . The proposal , to build wireless sensor nodes with a volume of one cubic millimeter , was selected for funding in 1998 . The project led to a working mote smaller than a grain of rice , [ 4 ] and larger `` COTS Dust '' devices kicked off the TinyOS effort at Berkeley ."
The concept was later expanded upon by Kris Pister in 2001 . [ 5 ] A recent review discusses various techniques to take smartdust in sensor networks beyond millimeter dimensions to the micrometre level . [ 6 ]
The Ultra-Fast Systems component of the Nanoelectronics Research Centre at the University of Glasgow is a founding member of a large international consortium which is developing a related concept : smart specks . [ 7 ]
"Smart Dust entered the Gartner Hype Cycle on Emerging Technologies in 2003 , [ 8 ] and returned in 2013 as the most speculative entrant . [ 9 ]"
