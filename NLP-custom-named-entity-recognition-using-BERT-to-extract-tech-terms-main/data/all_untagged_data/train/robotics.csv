Articulated robots
"Articulated robots [ 4 ] are the most common industrial robots . [ 5 ] They look like a human arm , which is why they are also called robotic arm or manipulator arm . [ 6 ] Their articulations with several degrees of freedom allow the articulated arms a wide range of movements ."

Main article : Cartesian coordinate robot
"Cartesian robots , [ 4 ] also called rectilinear , gantry robots , and x-y-z robots [ 5 ] have three prismatic joints for the movement of the tool and three rotary joints for its orientation in space ."
"To be able to move and orient the effector organ in all directions , such a robot needs 6 axes ( or degrees of freedom ) . In a 2-dimensional environment , three axes are sufficient , two for displacement and one for orientation . [ 7 ]"
Cylindrical coordinate robots
The cylindrical coordinate robots [ 4 ] are characterized by their rotary joint at the base and at least one prismatic joint connecting its links . [ 5 ] They can move vertically and horizontally by sliding . The compact effector design allows the robot to reach tight workspaces without any loss of speed . [ 5 ]
Spherical coordinate robots
"Spherical coordinate robots only have rotary joints . [ 4 ] They are one of the first robots to have been used in industrial applications . [ 5 ] They are commonly used for machine tending in die-casting , plastic injection and extrusion , and for welding . [ 5 ]"
SCARA robots
Main article : SCARA robot
SCARA [ 4 ] is an acronym for Selective Compliance Assembly Robot Arm . [ 8 ] SCARA robots are recognized by their two parallel joints which provide movement in the X-Y plane . [ 4 ] Rotating shafts are positioned vertically at the effector..
SCARA robots are used for jobs that require precise lateral movements . They are ideal for assembly applications . [ 5 ]
Delta robots
Delta robots [ 4 ] are also referred to as parallel link robots . [ 5 ] They consist of parallel links connected to a common base . Delta robots are particularly useful for direct control tasks and high maneuvering operations ( such as quick pick-and-place tasks ) . Delta robots take advantage of four bar or parallelogram linkage systems .
"Cobots , or collaborative robots , are robots intended for direct human robot interaction within a shared space , or where humans and robots are in close proximity . Cobot applications contrast with traditional industrial robot applications in which robots are isolated from human contact . [ 1 ] Cobot safety may rely on lightweight construction materials , rounded edges , and inherent limitation of speed and force , or on sensors and software that ensures safe behavior ."
Agricultural robots ( AgRobots ) . [ 28 ] The use of robots in agriculture is closely linked to the concept of AI-assisted precision agriculture and drone usage . [ 29 ] 1996-1998 research also proved that robots can perform a herding task .
Drone Swarming
"Swarm robotics is an approach to the coordination of multiple robots as a system which consist of large numbers of mostly simple physical robots . It is supposed that a desired collective behavior emerges from the interactions between the robots and interactions of robots with the environment . This approach emerged on the field of artificial swarm intelligence , as well as the biological studies of insects , ants and other fields in nature , where swarm behaviour occurs ."
"Home-telepresence robots can move around in a remote location and let one communicate with people there via its camera , speaker , and microphone ."
"Network robots link ubiquitous networks with robots , contributing to the creation of new lifestyles and solutions to address a variety of social problems including the aging of population and nursing care ."

"Within the ironing robots , Dressman is a mannequin to dry and iron shirts using hot air . [ 7 ] Other ones also includes mannequin for down parts ( pants , trousers and skirts ) . More advanced ones fold and organizes the clothes , as Laundroid ( using image analysis and artificial intelligence ) , Effie ( irons 12 items of clothing at once ) and FoldiMate ."
Cat litter robots are automatic self-cleaning litter boxes that filter clumps out into a built-in waste receptacle that can be lined with an ordinary plastic bag .
"Robotic kitchens include Rotimatic ( which makes rotis , tortillas , puris out of flour in just a few minutes ) , Moley Robotics MK1 and Prometheus delta robot ."
"Security robots such as Knightscope have a night-vision-capable wide-angle camera that detects movements and intruders . It can patrol places and shoot video of suspicious activities , too , and send alerts via email or text message ; the stored history of past alerts and videos are accessible via the Web . The robot can also be configured to go into action at any time of the day"
"There are also automated pool cleaners that clean and maintain swimming pools autonomously by scrubbing in-ground pools from the floor to the waterline in 3 hours , cleaning and circulating more than 70 US gallons ( 260 l ) of water per minute , and removing debris as small as 2 µm in size . [ 9 ]"
Gutter-cleaning robots such as Looj use brushes and rubber blades to remove debris from rain gutters ; users operate the device using a remote . [ 11 ]
"Window cleaning robots are most commonly used to clean outdoor windows , more specifically house windows . However , it may be used on other types of windows , such as ones on tall buildings and structures . This robot contains a movement system which allows the robot to navigate itself across the window surface in a defined direction . It also has a powered agitator located by the cleaning pad . When activated , the agitator gets rid of debris and dirt from the window surface . The cleaning pad directly interacts with the window surface and is directly responsible for removing the dirt by filling itself with specialized window cleaning fluid ."
"Robotic toys , such as the well known Furby , have been popular since 1998 . There are also small humanoid remote-controlled robots as well as electronic pets , such as robotic dogs . They have also have been used by many universities in competitions such as the RoboCup ."
"There are three main techniques used in genetic engineering : The plasmid method , the vector method and the biolistic method ."
Cochlear Implant
"Cochlear implants are a type of hearing aid for those who are deaf . Cochlear implants send electrical signals straight to the auditory nerve , the nerve responsible for sound signals , instead of just sending the signals to the ear canal like normal hearing aids ."
New Bone-Anchored ( Baha ) Hearing Aids
These hearing aids are also used for people with severe hearing loss . Baha hearing aids attach to the bones of the middle ear to create the sound vibrations in the skull and send those vibrations to the cochlea .
Artificial Sensing Skin
"This artificial sensing skin detects any pressure put on it and is meant for people who have lost any sense of feeling on parts of their bodies , such as diabetics with peripheral neuropathy ."
Bionic Eye
The bionic eye is a bioelectronic implant that restores vision for people with blindness .
Orthopedic Bionics
Orthopedic bionics consist of advanced bionic limbs that use a person 's neuromuscular system to control the bionic limb .
Endoscopic Robotics
These robotics can remove a polyp during a colonoscopy .
"The vast majority of robots use electric motors , often brushed and brushless DC motors in portable robots or AC motors in industrial robots and CNC machines . These motors are often preferred in systems with lighter loads , and where the predominant form of motion is rotational ."
"Various types of linear actuators move in and out instead of by spinning , and often have quicker direction changes , particularly when very large forces are needed such as with industrial robotics . They are typically powered by compressed and oxidized air ( pneumatic actuator ) or an oil ( hydraulic actuator ) Linear actuators can also be powered by electricity which usually consists of a motor and a leadscrew . Another common type is a mechanical linear actuator that is turned by hand , such as a rack and pinion on a car ."
"Series elastic actuation ( SEA ) relies on the idea of introducing intentional elasticity between the motor actuator and the load for robust force control . Due to the resultant lower reflected inertia , series elastic actuation improves safety when a robot interacts with the environment ( e.g. , humans or workpiece ) or during collisions . [ 38 ] Furthermore , it also provides energy efficiency and shock absorption ( mechanical filtering ) while reducing excessive wear on the transmission and other mechanical components . This approach has successfully been employed in various robots , particularly advanced manufacturing robots [ 39 ] and walking humanoid robots ."
"Muscle wire , also known as shape memory alloy , Nitinol® or Flexinol® wire , is a material which contracts ( under 5 % ) when electricity is applied . They have been used for some small robot applications ."
"Recent alternatives to DC motors are piezo motors or ultrasonic motors . These work on a fundamentally different principle , whereby tiny piezoceramic elements , vibrating many thousands of times per second , cause linear or rotary motion . There are different mechanisms of operation ; one type uses the vibration of the piezo elements to step the motor in a circle or a straight line . [ 53 ] Another type uses the piezo elements to cause a nut to vibrate or to drive a screw . The advantages of these motors are nanometer resolution , speed , and available force for their size . [ 54 ] These motors are already available commercially , and being used on some robots ."
"Elastic nanotubes are a promising artificial muscle technology in early-stage experimental development . The absence of defects in carbon nanotubes enables these filaments to deform elastically by several percent , with energy storage levels of perhaps 10 J/cm3 for metal nanotubes . Human biceps could be replaced with an 8 mm diameter wire of this material . Such compact `` muscle '' might allow future robots to outrun and outjump humans ."
Mechanical grippers
"One of the most common types of end-effectors are `` grippers '' . In its simplest manifestation , it consists of just two fingers that can open and close to pick up and let go of a range of small objects . Fingers can , for example , be made of a chain with a metal wire run through it . [ 66 ] Hands that resemble and work more like a human hand include the Shadow Hand and the Robonaut hand . [ 67 ] Hands that are of a mid-level complexity include the Delft hand . [ 68 ] [ 69 ] Mechanical grippers can come in various types , including friction and encompassing jaws . Friction jaws use all the force of the gripper to hold the object in place using friction . Encompassing jaws cradle the object in place , using less friction ."
Suction end-effectors
"Suction end-effectors , powered by vacuum generators , are very simple astrictive [ 70 ] devices that can hold very large loads provided the prehension surface is smooth enough to ensure suction ."
"Pick and place robots for electronic components and for large objects like car windscreens , often use very simple vacuum end-effectors ."
"Suction is a highly used type of end-effector in industry , in part because the natural compliance of soft suction end-effectors can enable a robot to be more robust in the presence of imperfect robotic perception . As an example : consider the case of a robot vision system estimates the position of a water bottle , but has 1 centimeter of error . While this may cause a rigid mechanical gripper to puncture the water bottle , the soft suction end-effector may just bend slightly and conform to the shape of the water bottle surface ."
General purpose effectors
"Some advanced robots are beginning to use fully humanoid hands , like the Shadow Hand , MANUS , [ 71 ] and the Schunk hand . [ 72 ] These are highly dexterous manipulators , with as many as 20 degrees of freedom and hundreds of tactile sensors ."
Rolling robots
Segway in the Robot museum in Nagoya
"For simplicity , most mobile robots have four wheels or a number of continuous tracks . Some researchers have tried to create more complex wheeled robots with only one or two wheels . These can have certain advantages such as greater efficiency and reduced parts , as well as allowing a robot to navigate in confined places that a four-wheeled robot would not be able to ."
Two-wheeled balancing robots
"Balancing robots generally use a gyroscope to detect how much a robot is falling and then drive the wheels proportionally in the same direction , to counterbalance the fall at hundreds of times per second , based on the dynamics of an inverted pendulum . [ 74 ] Many different balancing robots have been designed . [ 75 ] While the Segway is not commonly thought of as a robot , it can be thought of as a component of a robot , when used as such Segway refer to them as RMP ( Robotic Mobility Platform ) . An example of this use has been as NASA 's Robonaut that has been mounted on a Segway . [ 76 ]"
One-wheeled balancing robots
Self-balancing unicycle
"A one-wheeled balancing robot is an extension of a two-wheeled balancing robot so that it can move in any 2D direction using a round ball as its only wheel . Several one-wheeled balancing robots have been designed recently , such as Carnegie Mellon University 's `` Ballbot '' that is the approximate height and width of a person , and Tohoku Gakuin University 's `` BallIP '' . [ 77 ] Because of the long , thin shape and ability to maneuver in tight spaces , they have the potential to function better than other robots in environments with people . [ 78 ]"
Spherical orb robots
Spherical robot
"Several attempts have been made in robots that are completely inside a spherical ball , either by spinning a weight inside the ball , [ 79 ] [ 80 ] or by rotating the outer shells of the sphere . [ 81 ] [ 82 ] These have also been referred to as an orb bot [ 83 ] or a ball bot . [ 84 ] [ 85 ]"
Six-wheeled robots
Using six wheels instead of four wheels can give better traction or grip in outdoor terrain such as on rocky dirt or grass .
"The zero moment point ( ZMP ) is the algorithm used by robots such as Honda 's ASIMO . The robot 's onboard computer tries to keep the total inertial forces ( the combination of Earth 's gravity and the acceleration and deceleration of walking ) , exactly opposed by the floor reaction force ( the force of the floor pushing back on the robot 's foot ) . In this way , the two forces cancel out , leaving no moment ( force causing the robot to rotate and fall over ) . [ 90 ] However , this is not exactly how a human walks , and the difference is obvious to human observers , some of whom have pointed out that ASIMO walks as if it needs the lavatory . [ 91 ] [ 92 ] [ 93 ] ASIMO 's walking algorithm is not static , and some dynamic balancing is used ( see below ) . However , it still requires a smooth surface to walk on ."
"Land or home robots are usually referred to as Unmanned Ground Vehicles ( UGVs ) . They are most commonly wheeled or tracked , but also include legged robots with two or more legs ( humanoid , or resembling animals or insects ) ."
Delivery & Transportation robots can move materials and supplies through a work environment
Aerial robots are usually referred to as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles ( UAVs )
Underwater robots are usually called autonomous underwater vehicles ( AUVs )
"Polar robots , designed to navigate icy , crevasse filled environments"
Legged robot : human-like legs ( i.e . an android ) or animal-like legs .
Wheeled robot
"A guarded tele-op robot has the ability to sense and avoid obstacles but will otherwise navigate as driven , like a robot under manual tele-op . Few if any mobile robots offer only guarded tele-op ."
"Some of the earliest Automated Guided Vehicles ( AGVs ) were line following mobile robots . They might follow a visual line painted or embedded in the floor or ceiling or an electrical wire in the floor . Most of these robots operated a simple `` keep the line in the center sensor '' algorithm . They could not circumnavigate obstacles ; they just stopped and waited when something blocked their path . Many examples of such vehicles are still sold , by Transbotics , FMC , Egemin , HK Systems and many other companies . These types of robots are still widely popular in well known Robotic societies as a first step towards learning nooks and corners of robotics ."
"Scientists use AUVs to study lakes , the ocean , and the ocean floor . A variety of sensors can be affixed to AUVs to measure the concentration of various elements or compounds , the absorption or reflection of light , and the presence of microscopic life . Examples include conductivity-temperature-depth sensors ( CTDs ) , fluorometers , and pH sensors . Additionally , AUVs can be configured as tow-vehicles to deliver customized sensor packages to specific locations ."
"Radio waves can not penetrate water very far , so as soon as an AUV dives it loses its GPS signal . Therefore , a standard way for AUVs to navigate underwater is through dead reckoning . Navigation can however be improved by using an underwater acoustic positioning system . When operating within a net of sea floor deployed baseline transponders this is known as LBL navigation . When a surface reference such as a support ship is available , ultra-short baseline ( USBL ) or short-baseline ( SBL ) positioning is used to calculate where the sub-sea vehicle is relative to the known ( GPS ) position of the surface craft by means of acoustic range and bearing measurements . To improve estimation of its position , and reduce errors in dead reckoning ( which grow over time ) , the AUV can also surface and take its own GPS fix . Between position fixes and for precise maneuvering , an Inertial Navigation System on board the AUV calculates through dead reckoning the AUV position , acceleration , and velocity . Estimates can be made using data from an Inertial Measurement Unit , and can be improved by adding a Doppler Velocity Log ( DVL ) , which measures the rate of travel over the sea/lake floor . Typically , a pressure sensor measures the vertical position ( vehicle depth ) , although depth and altitude can also be obtained from DVL measurements . These observations are filtered to determine a final navigation solution ."
"Underwater gliders do not directly propel themselves . By changing their buoyancy and trim , they repeatedly sink and ascend ; airfoil `` wings '' convert this up-and-down motion to forward motion . The change of buoyancy is typically done through the use of a pump that can take in or push out water . The vehicle 's pitch can be controlled by changing the center of mass of the vehicle ."
"As of 2008 , the smallest microrobots use a Scratch Drive Actuator ."
"A robotic spacecraft is an uncrewed spacecraft , usually under telerobotic control . A robotic spacecraft designed to make scientific research measurements is often called a space probe . Many space missions are more suited to telerobotic rather than crewed operation , due to lower cost and lower risk factors . In addition , some planetary destinations such as Venus or the vicinity of Jupiter are too hostile for human survival , given current technology . Outer planets such as Saturn , Uranus , and Neptune are too distant to reach with current crewed spacecraft technology , so telerobotic probes are the only way to explore them ."
"Many artificial satellites are robotic spacecraft , as are many landers and rovers ."
"An autonomous underwater vehicle ( AUV ) is a robot that travels underwater without requiring input from an operator . AUVs constitute part of a larger group of undersea systems known as unmanned underwater vehicles , a classification that includes non-autonomous remotely operated underwater vehicles ( ROVs ) – controlled and powered from the surface by an operator/pilot via an umbilical or using remote control . In military applications an AUV is more often referred to as an unmanned undersea vehicle ( UUV ) . Underwater gliders are a subclass of AUVs ."
"AUVs carry sensors to navigate autonomously and map features of the ocean . Typical sensors include compasses , depth sensors , sidescan and other sonars , magnetometers , thermistors and conductivity probes . Some AUVs are outfitted with biological sensors including fluorometers ( also known as chlorophyll sensors ) , turbidity sensors , and sensors to measure pH , and amounts of dissolved oxygen ."
"An example of an AUV interacting directly with its environment is the Crown-Of-Thorns Starfish Robot ( COTSBot ) created by the Queensland University of Technology ( QUT ) . The COTSBot finds and eradicates crown-of-thorns starfish ( Acanthaster planci ) , a species that damages the Great Barrier Reef . It uses a neural network to identify the starfish and injects bile salts to kill it ."
