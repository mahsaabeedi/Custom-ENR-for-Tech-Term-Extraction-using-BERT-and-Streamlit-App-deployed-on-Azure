"Vertical farming is the practice of growing crops in vertically stacked layers . [ 1 ] It often incorporates controlled-environment agriculture , which aims to optimize plant growth , and soilless farming techniques such as hydroponics , aquaponics , and aeroponics . [ 1 ] Some common choices of structures to house vertical farming systems include buildings , shipping containers , tunnels , and abandoned mine shafts . As of 2020 , there is the equivalent of about 30 ha ( 74 acres ) of operational vertical farmland in the world . [ 2 ] The modern concept of vertical farming was proposed in 1999 by Dickson Despommier , professor of Public and Environmental Health at Columbia University . [ 3 ] Despommier and his students came up with a design of a skyscraper farm that could feed 50,000 people . [ 4 ] Although the design has not yet been built , it successfully popularized the idea of vertical farming . [ 4 ] Current applications of vertical farmings coupled with other state-of-the-art technologies , such as specialized LED lights , have resulted in over 10 times the crop yield than would receive through traditional farming methods ."
"Fruit picking robots , driverless tractor / sprayers , and sheep shearing robots are designed to replace human labor ."
"A brain–computer interface ( BCI ) , sometimes called a neural control interface ( NCI ) , mind–machine interface ( MMI ) , direct neural interface ( DNI ) , or brain–machine interface ( BMI ) , is a direct communication pathway between an enhanced or wired brain and an external device . BCIs are often directed at researching , mapping , assisting , augmenting , or repairing human cognitive or sensory-motor functions ."
An ion thruster or ion drive is a form of electric propulsion used for spacecraft propulsion . It creates thrust by accelerating ions using electricity .
"A plasma propulsion engine is a type of electric propulsion that generates thrust from a quasi-neutral plasma . This is in contrast with ion thruster engines , which generate thrust through extracting an ion current from the plasma source , which is then accelerated to high velocities using grids/anodes . These exist in many forms ( see electric propulsion ) . Plasma thrusters do not typically use high voltage grids or anodes/cathodes to accelerate the charged particles in the plasma , but rather use currents and potentials which are generated internally in the plasma to accelerate the plasma ions . While this results in a lower exhaust velocity by virtue of the lack of high accelerating voltages , this type of thruster has a number of advantages . The lack of high voltage grids of anodes removes a possible limiting element as a result of grid ion erosion . The plasma exhaust is 'quasi-neutral ' , which means that ions and electrons exist in equal number , which allows simple ion-electron recombination in the exhaust to neutralize the exhaust plume , removing the need for an electron gun ( hollow cathode ) . This type of thruster often generates the source plasma using radiofrequency or microwave energy , using an external antenna ."
"Claytronics is an abstract future concept that combines nanoscale robotics and computer science to create individual nanometer-scale computers called claytronic atoms , or catoms , which can interact with each other to form tangible 3D objects that a user can interact with . This idea is more broadly referred to as programmable matter . [ 1 ] Claytronics has the potential to greatly affect many areas of daily life , such as telecommunication , human-computer interfaces , and entertainment ."
"A molecular assembler , as defined by K. Eric Drexler , is a `` proposed device able to guide chemical reactions by positioning reactive molecules with atomic precision '' . A molecular assembler is a kind of molecular machine . Some biological molecules such as ribosomes fit this definition . This is because they receive instructions from messenger RNA and then assemble specific sequences of amino acids to construct protein molecules . However , the term `` molecular assembler '' usually refers to theoretical human-made devices ."
"Utility fog ( coined by Dr. John Storrs Hall in 1989 [ 1 ] [ 2 ] ) is a hypothetical collection of tiny robots that can replicate a physical structure . [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] As such , it is a form of self-reconfiguring modular robotics ."
"A domed city is a hypothetical structure that encloses a large urban area under a single roof . In most descriptions , the dome is airtight and pressurized , creating a habitat that can be controlled for air temperature , composition and quality , typically due to an external atmosphere ( or lack thereof ) that is inimical to habitation for one or more reasons . Domed cities have been a fixture of science fiction and futurology since the early 20th century , and may be situated on Earth , a moon or other planet ."
"Aerogel is a synthetic porous ultralight material derived from a gel , in which the liquid component for the gel has been replaced with a gas without significant collapse of the gel structure . [ 4 ] The result is a solid with extremely low density [ 5 ] and extremely low thermal conductivity . Nicknames include frozen smoke , [ 6 ] solid smoke , solid air , solid cloud , blue smoke owing to its translucent nature and the way light scatters in the material . Silica aerogels feel like fragile expanded polystyrene to the touch , while some polymer-based aerogels feel like rigid foams . Aerogels can be made from a variety of chemical compounds ."
"An amorphous metal ( also known as metallic glass or glassy metal ) is a solid metallic material , usually an alloy , with disordered atomic-scale structure . Most metals are crystalline in their solid state , which means they have a highly ordered arrangement of atoms . Amorphous metals are non-crystalline , and have a glass-like structure . But unlike common glasses , such as window glass , which are typically electrical insulators , amorphous metals have good electrical conductivity and they also display superconductivity at low temperatures ."
"There are several ways in which amorphous metals can be produced , including extremely rapid cooling , physical vapor deposition , solid-state reaction , ion irradiation , and mechanical alloying . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] Previously , small batches of amorphous metals had been produced through a variety of quick-cooling methods , such as amorphous metal ribbons which had been produced by sputtering molten metal onto a spinning metal disk ( melt spinning ) . The rapid cooling ( in the order of millions of degrees Celsius a second ) is too fast for crystals to form and the material is `` locked '' in a glassy state . Currently , a number of alloys with critical cooling rates low enough to allow formation of amorphous structure in thick layers ( over 1 millimeter ) have been produced ; these are known as bulk metallic glasses ( BMG ) . More recently , batches of amorphous steel with three times the strength of conventional steel alloys have been produced ."
"Bioplastics are plastic materials produced from renewable biomass sources , such as vegetable fats and oils , corn starch , straw , woodchips , sawdust , recycled food waste , etc . Bioplastic can be made from agricultural by-products and also from used plastics ( i.e . plastic bottles and other containers ) by using microorganisms . Bioplastics are usually derived from sugar derivatives , including starch , cellulose , and lactic acid . Common plastics , such as fossil-fuel plastics ( also called petrobased polymers ) are derived from petroleum or natural gas ."
"Conductive polymers or , more precisely , intrinsically conducting polymers ( ICPs ) are organic polymers that conduct electricity . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] Such compounds may have metallic conductivity or can be semiconductors . The biggest advantage of conductive polymers is their processability , mainly by dispersion . Conductive polymers are generally not thermoplastics , i.e. , they are not thermoformable . But , like insulating polymers , they are organic materials . They can offer high electrical conductivity but do not show similar mechanical properties to other commercially available polymers . The electrical properties can be fine-tuned using the methods of organic synthesis [ 3 ] and by advanced dispersion techniques ."
"Conductive polymers show promise in antistatic materials [ 3 ] and they have been incorporated into commercial displays and batteries . Literature suggests they are also promising in organic solar cells , printed electronic circuits , organic light-emitting diodes , actuators , electrochromism , supercapacitors , chemical sensors and biosensors , [ 28 ] flexible transparent displays , electromagnetic shielding and possibly replacement for the popular transparent conductor indium tin oxide . Another use is for microwave-absorbent coatings , particularly radar-absorptive coatings on stealth aircraft . Conducting polymers are rapidly gaining attraction in new applications with increasingly processable materials with better electrical and physical properties and lower costs . The new nano-structured forms of conducting polymers particularly , augment this field with their higher surface area and better dispersability . Research reports showed that nanostructured conducting polymers in the form of nanofibers and nanosponges , showed significantly improved capacitance values as compared to their non-nanostructured counterparts ."
Most recent emphasis is on organic light emitting diodes and organic polymer solar cells . [ 33 ] The Organic Electronics Association is an international platform to promote applications of organic semiconductors . Conductive polymer products with embedded and improved electromagnetic interference ( EMI ) and electrostatic discharge ( ESD ) protection have led to both prototypes and products .
"A cryogenic treatment is the process of treating workpieces to cryogenic temperatures ( i.e . below -190 °C ( -310 °F ) ) in order to remove residual stresses and improve wear resistance on steels and even composites . In addition to seeking enhanced stress relief and stabilization , or wear resistance , cryogenic treatment is also sought for its ability to improve corrosion resistance by precipitating micro-fine eta carbides , which can be measured before and after in a part using a quantimet ."
Dynamic armour or electric armour is a type of armour proposed for the protection of ships and armoured fighting vehicles [ 1 ] from shaped charge weapons . Dynamic armour uses a strong electric field to disrupt the jet of ionized gas produced by a warhead .
"A fullerene is an allotrope of carbon whose molecule consists of carbon atoms connected by single and double bonds so as to form a closed or partially closed mesh , with fused rings of five to seven atoms . The molecule may be a hollow sphere , ellipsoid , tube , or many other shapes and sizes . Graphene ( isolated atomic layers of graphite ) , which is a flat mesh of regular hexagonal rings , can be seen as an extreme member of the family ."
"Graphene ( /'græfi ? n/ [ 1 ] ) is an allotrope of carbon consisting of a single layer of atoms arranged in a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice . [ 2 ] [ 3 ] The name is a portmanteau of `` graphite '' and the suffix -ene , reflecting the fact that the graphite allotrope of carbon consists of stacked graphene layers ."
"Graphene is a transparent and flexible conductor that holds great promise for various material/device applications , including solar cells , [ 303 ] light-emitting diodes ( LED ) , touch panels , and smart windows or phones . [ 304 ] Smartphone products with graphene touch screens are already on the market ."
"A lab-on-a-chip ( LOC ) is a device that integrates one or several laboratory functions on a single integrated circuit ( commonly called a `` chip '' ) of only millimeters to a few square centimeters to achieve automation and high-throughput screening . [ 1 ] LOCs can handle extremely small fluid volumes down to less than pico-liters . Lab-on-a-chip devices are a subset of microelectromechanical systems ( MEMS ) devices and sometimes called `` micro total analysis systems '' ( µTAS ) . LOCs may use microfluidics , the physics , manipulation and study of minute amounts of fluids . However , strictly regarded `` lab-on-a-chip '' indicates generally the scaling of single or multiple lab processes down to chip-format , whereas `` µTAS '' is dedicated to the integration of the total sequence of lab processes to perform chemical analysis . The term `` lab-on-a-chip '' was introduced when it turned out that µTAS technologies were applicable for more than only analysis purposes ."
"High-temperature superconductors ( abbreviated high-Tc or HTS ) are operatively defined as materials that behave as superconductors at temperatures above 77 K ( -196.2 °C ; -321.1 °F ) , the boiling point of liquid nitrogen , one of the simplest coolants in cryogenics . [ 1 ] All superconducting materials known at ordinary pressures currently work far below ambient temperatures and therefore require cooling . The majority of high-temperature superconductors are ceramic materials . On the other hand , Metallic superconductors usually work below -200 °C : they are then called low-temperature superconductors . Metallic superconductors are also ordinary superconductors , since they were discovered and used before the high-temperature ones ."
"Magnetic nanoparticles are a class of nanoparticle that can be manipulated using magnetic fields . Such particles commonly consist of two components , a magnetic material , often iron , nickel and cobalt , and a chemical component that has functionality . While nanoparticles are smaller than 1 micrometer in diameter ( typically 1–100 nanometers ) , the larger microbeads are 0.5–500 micrometer in diameter . Magnetic nanoparticle clusters that are composed of a number of individual magnetic nanoparticles are known as magnetic nanobeads with a diameter of 50–200 nanometers . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] Magnetic nanoparticle clusters are a basis for their further magnetic assembly into magnetic nanochains . [ 3 ] The magnetic nanoparticles have been the focus of much research recently because they possess attractive properties which could see potential use in catalysis including nanomaterial-based catalysts , [ 4 ] biomedicine [ 5 ] and tissue specific targeting , [ 6 ] magnetically tunable colloidal photonic crystals , [ 7 ] microfluidics , [ 8 ] magnetic resonance imaging , [ 9 ] magnetic particle imaging , [ 10 ] data storage , [ 11 ] [ 12 ] environmental remediation , [ 13 ] nanofluids , [ 14 ] [ 15 ] optical filters , [ 16 ] defect sensor , [ 17 ] magnetic cooling [ 18 ] [ 19 ] and cation sensors ."
"A magnetorheological fluid ( MR fluid , or MRF ) is a type of smart fluid in a carrier fluid , usually a type of oil . When subjected to a magnetic field , the fluid greatly increases its apparent viscosity , to the point of becoming a viscoelastic solid . Importantly , the yield stress of the fluid when in its active ( `` on '' ) state can be controlled very accurately by varying the magnetic field intensity . The upshot is that the fluid 's ability to transmit force can be controlled with an electromagnet , which gives rise to its many possible control-based applications . Extensive discussions of the physics and applications of MR fluids can be found in a recent book ."
"Magnetorheological dampers of various applications have been and continue to be developed . These dampers are mainly used in heavy industry with applications such as heavy motor damping , operator seat/cab damping in construction vehicles , and more ."
"Magnetorheological finishing , a magnetorheological fluid-based optical polishing method , has proven to be highly precise . It was used in the construction of the Hubble Space Telescope 's corrective lens ."
"If the shock absorbers of a vehicle 's suspension are filled with magnetorheological fluid instead of a plain oil or gas , and the channels which allow the damping fluid to flow between the two chambers is surrounded with electromagnets , the viscosity of the fluid , and hence the critical frequency of the damper , can be varied depending on driver preference or the weight being carried by the vehicle - or it may be dynamically varied in order to provide stability control across vastly different road conditions . This is in effect a magnetorheological damper ."
"Microfluidics refers to the behaviour , precise control , and manipulation of fluids that are geometrically constrained to a small scale ( typically sub-millimeter ) at which surface forces dominate volumetric forces . It is a multidisciplinary field that involves engineering , physics , chemistry , biochemistry , nanotechnology , and biotechnology . It has practical applications in the design of systems that process low volumes of fluids to achieve multiplexing , automation , and high-throughput screening . Microfluidics emerged in the beginning of the 1980s and is used in the development of inkjet printheads , DNA chips , lab-on-a-chip technology , micro-propulsion , and micro-thermal technologies ."

"Superfluidity is the characteristic property of a fluid with zero viscosity which therefore flows without any loss of kinetic energy . When stirred , a superfluid forms vortices that continue to rotate indefinitely . Superfluidity occurs in two isotopes of helium ( helium-3 and helium-4 ) when they are liquefied by cooling to cryogenic temperatures . It is also a property of various other exotic states of matter theorized to exist in astrophysics , high-energy physics , and theories of quantum gravity . [ 1 ] The theory of superfluidity was developed by Soviet theoretical physicists Lev Landau and Isaak Khalatnikov ."
"Metamaterial antennas are a class of antennas that use metamaterials to improve performance . [ 13 ] [ 17 ] [ 72 ] [ 73 ] Demonstrations showed that metamaterials could enhance an antenna 's radiated power . [ 13 ] [ 74 ] Materials that can attain negative permeability allow for properties such as small antenna size , high directivity and tunable frequency ."
"A metamaterial absorber manipulates the loss components of metamaterials ' permittivity and magnetic permeability , to absorb large amounts of electromagnetic radiation . This is a useful feature for photodetection [ 75 ] [ 76 ] and solar photovoltaic applications . [ 77 ] Loss components are also relevant in applications of negative refractive index ( photonic metamaterials , antenna systems ) or transformation optics ( metamaterial cloaking , celestial mechanics ) , but often are not utilized in these applications ."
"A superlens is a two or three-dimensional device that uses metamaterials , usually with negative refraction properties , to achieve resolution beyond the diffraction limit ( ideally , infinite resolution ) . Such a behaviour is enabled by the capability of double-negative materials to yield negative phase velocity . The diffraction limit is inherent in conventional optical devices or lenses ."
"Metamaterials are a potential basis for a practical cloaking device . The proof of principle was demonstrated on October 19 , 2006 . No practical cloaks are publicly known to exist ."
"Conventionally , the RCS has been reduced either by Radar absorbent material ( RAM ) or by purpose shaping of the targets such that the scattered energy can be redirected away from the source . While RAMs have narrow frequency band functionality , purpose shaping limits the aerodynamic performance of the target . More recently , metamaterials or metasurfaces are synthesized that can redirect the scattered energy away from the source using either array theory [ 86 ] [ 87 ] [ 88 ] [ 89 ] or generalized Snell 's law . [ 90 ] [ 91 ] This has led to aerodynamically favorable shapes for the targets with the reduced RCS ."

A metal foam is a cellular structure consisting of a solid metal ( frequently aluminium ) with gas-filled pores comprising a large portion of the volume . The pores can be sealed ( closed-cell foam ) or interconnected ( open-cell foam ) . The defining characteristic of metal foams is a high porosity : typically only 5–25 % of the volume is the base metal . The strength of the material is due to the square-cube law .
"The primary functions of metallic foams in vehicles are to increase sound damping , reduce weight , increase energy absorption in case of crashes , and ( in military applications ) to combat the concussive force of IEDs . As an example , foam filled tubes could be used as anti-intrusion bars ."
"Many applications such as Re-configurable aircraft wings , shape-changing aerodynamic panels for flow control , Variable geometry engine exhausts , turbine blade , wind turbine configuration at different wind speed , Microelectromechanical systems ( micro-switches ) , mechanical memory cells , valves , micropumps , Flexible direction panel position in solar cells , Innovative architecture ( adaptive shape panels for roofs and windows ) , Flexible and foldable electronic devices and Optics ( shape changing mirrors for active focusing in adaptive optical systems )"
Cellular automata are a useful concept to abstract some of the concepts of discrete units interacting to give a desired overall behavior .
"Quantum wells can hold one or more electrons . Those electrons behave like artificial atoms which , like real atoms , can form covalent bonds , but these are extremely weak . Because of their larger sizes , other properties are also widely different ."
"Power dissipation within traditional metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors ( MOSFETs ) generates a bottleneck when dealing with nano-electronics . Tunnel field-effect transistors ( TFETs ) may become an alternative to traditional MOSFETs because they can have a smaller subthreshold slope and supply voltage , which reduce power dissipation ."
"A superalloy , or high-performance alloy , is an alloy with the ability to operate at a high fraction of its melting point . [ 1 ] Several key characteristics of a superalloy are excellent mechanical strength , resistance to thermal creep deformation , good surface stability , and resistance to corrosion or oxidation ."
"Synthetic diamond ( also referred to as laboratory-grown diamond , laboratory-created diamond , or cultured diamond ) is a diamond made of the same material as natural diamonds : pure carbon , crystallized in an isotropic 3D form . [ 1 ] Synthetic diamonds are different from both natural diamond , which is created by geological processes , and diamond simulant , which is made of non-diamond material ."
"Most materials with high thermal conductivity are also electrically conductive , such as metals . In contrast , pure synthetic diamond has high thermal conductivity , but negligible electrical conductivity . This combination is invaluable for electronics where diamond is used as a heat sink for high-power laser diodes , laser arrays and high-power transistors . Efficient heat dissipation prolongs the lifetime of those electronic devices , and the devices ' high replacement costs justify the use of efficient , though relatively expensive , diamond heat sinks ."
"First proposed by Frank Wilczek in 2012 as a progression of the universal model of spacetime , a time crystal is a temporal analog to common crystals , which are spatially highly symmetrical and yet non-uniform in their structure . In terms of practical use , time crystals may one day be used as quantum memories ."
"Translucent concrete ( also : light-transmitting concrete ) is a concrete based building material with light-transmissive properties due to embedded light optical elements — usually optical fibers . Light is conducted through the stone from one end to the other . Therefore , the fibers have to go through the whole object . This results in a certain light pattern on the other surface , depending on the fiber structure . Shadows cast onto one side appear as silhouettes through the material ."
"A drone display is the use of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles ( drones ) , often quadcopters , flying in a coordinated fashion for public display . They are usually equipped with LEDs , and the display held at night . The first drone display was presented in 2012 in Linz/Austria , where the Ars Electronica Futurelab introduced SPAXELS ( short for `` space elements '' ) for the first time . The displays may be for entertainment , where the drones may use flocking or swarming behaviour . [ 1 ] The drones may also be coordinated to produce images . Using this emerging technology , displays have been employed for advertising purposes as well ."
"A flexible display or rollable display is an electronic visual display which is flexible in nature , as opposed to the traditional flat screen displays used in most electronic devices . In recent years there has been a growing interest from numerous consumer electronics manufacturers to apply this display technology in e-readers , mobile phones and other consumer electronics . Such screens can be rolled up like a scroll without the image or text being distorted . [ 1 ] Technologies involved in building a rollable display include electronic ink , Gyricon , Organic LCD , and OLED ."
"A volumetric display device is a graphic display device that forms a visual representation of an object in three physical dimensions , as opposed to the planar image of traditional screens that simulate depth through a number of different visual effects . One definition offered by pioneers in the field is that volumetric displays create 3D imagery via the emission , scattering , or relaying of illumination from well-defined regions in ( x , y , z ) space ."
"Volumetric 3D displays embody just one family of 3D displays in general . Other types of 3D displays are : stereograms / stereoscopes , view-sequential displays , electro-holographic displays , parallax `` two view '' displays and parallax panoramagrams ( which are typically spatially multiplexed systems such as lenticular-sheet displays and parallax barrier displays ) , re-imaging systems , and others ."
"Laser color television ( laser TV ) , or laser color video display utilizes two or more individually modulated optical ( laser ) rays of different colors to produce a combined spot that is scanned and projected across the image plane by a polygon-mirror system or less effectively by optoelectronic means to produce a color-television display . The systems work either by scanning the entire picture a dot at a time and modulating the laser directly at high frequency , much like the electron beams in a cathode ray tube , or by optically spreading and then modulating the laser and scanning a line at a time , the line itself being modulated in much the same way as with digital light processing ( DLP ) ."
A holographic display is a type of display that utilizes light diffraction to create a virtual three-dimensional image . Holographic displays are distinguished from other forms of 3D displays in that they do not require the aid of any special glasses or external equipment for a viewer to see the image .
Computer-generated holography ( CGH ) is the method of digitally generating holographic interference patterns . A holographic image can be generated e.g . by digitally computing a holographic interference pattern and printing it onto a mask or film for subsequent illumination by suitable coherent light source .
"An optical transistor , also known as an optical switch or a light valve , is a device that switches or amplifies optical signals . Light occurring on an optical transistor ’ s input changes the intensity of light emitted from the transistor ’ s output while output power is supplied by an additional optical source . Since the input signal intensity may be weaker than that of the source , an optical transistor amplifies the optical signal . The device is the optical analog of the electronic transistor that forms the basis of modern electronic devices . Optical transistors provide a means to control light using only light and has applications in optical computing and fiber-optic communication networks . Such technology has the potential to exceed the speed of electronics [ citation needed ] , while conserving more power ."
"Screenless video is any system for transmitting visual information from a video source without the use of a screen . Screenless computing systems can be divided into three groups : Visual Image , Retinal Direct , and Synaptic Interface ."
"Visual Image screenless display includes any image that the eye can perceive . The most common example of Visual Image screenless display is a hologram . In these cases , light is reflected off some intermediate object ( hologram , LCD panel , or cockpit window ) before it reaches the retina . In the case of LCD panels the light is refracted from the back of the panel , but is nonetheless a reflected source . Google has proposed a similar system to replace the screens of tablet computers and smartphones ."
Virtual retinal display systems are a class of screenless displays in which images are projected directly onto the retina .
"A virtual retinal display ( VRD ) , also known as a retinal scan display ( RSD ) or retinal projector ( RP ) , is a display technology that draws a raster display ( like a television ) directly onto the retina of the eye . The user sees what appears to be a conventional display floating in space in front of them ."
"Bionic contact lenses are devices that , it is proposed by the manufacturers and developers , could provide a virtual display that could have a variety of uses from assisting the visually impaired to video gaming . [ 1 ] The device will have the form of a conventional contact lens with added bionics technology in the form of augmented reality , [ 2 ] with functional electronic circuits and infrared lights to create a virtual display [ 3 ] allowing the viewer to see a computer-generated display superimposed on the world outside ."
"Augmented reality ( AR ) is an interactive experience of a real-world environment where the objects that reside in the real world are enhanced by computer-generated perceptual information , sometimes across multiple sensory modalities , including visual , auditory , haptic , somatosensory and olfactory . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] AR can be defined as a system that fulfills three basic features : a combination of real and virtual worlds , real-time interaction , and accurate 3D registration of virtual and real objects . [ 3 ] The overlaid sensory information can be constructive ( i.e . additive to the natural environment ) , or destructive ( i.e . masking of the natural environment ) . [ 4 ] This experience is seamlessly interwoven with the physical world such that it is perceived as an immersive aspect of the real environment . [ 4 ] In this way , augmented reality alters one 's ongoing perception of a real-world environment , whereas virtual reality completely replaces the user 's real-world environment with a simulated one . [ 5 ] [ 6 ] Augmented reality is related to two largely synonymous terms : mixed reality and computer-mediated reality ."
Augmented reality also has a lot of potential in the gathering and sharing of tacit knowledge . Augmentation techniques are typically performed in real time and in semantic contexts with environmental elements . Immersive perceptual information is sometimes combined with supplemental information like scores over a live video feed of a sporting event . This combines the benefits of both augmented reality technology and heads up display technology ( HUD ) .
Virtual reality is most commonly used in entertainment applications such as video games and 3D cinema .
"Virtual reality ( VR ) is a simulated experience that can be similar to or completely different from the real world . Applications of virtual reality include entertainment ( e.g . video games ) and education ( e.g . medical or military training ) . Other distinct types of VR-style technology include augmented reality and mixed reality , sometimes referred to as extended reality or XR . [ 1 ]"
"One may distinguish between two types of VR ; immersive VR and text-based networked VR ( also known as `` Cyberspace '' ) . [ 2 ] The immersive VR changes your view , when you move your head . While both VRs are appropriate for training , Cyberspace is preferred for distance learning . [ 2 ] In some cases these two types are even complementary to each other . This page mainly focuses on the immersive VR ."
"Currently , standard virtual reality systems use either virtual reality headsets or multi-projected environments to generate realistic images , sounds and other sensations that simulate a user 's physical presence in a virtual environment . A person using virtual reality equipment is able to look around the artificial world , move around in it , and interact with virtual features or items . The effect is commonly created by VR headsets consisting of a head-mounted display with a small screen in front of the eyes , but can also be created through specially designed rooms with multiple large screens . Virtual reality typically incorporates auditory and video feedback , but may also allow other types of sensory and force feedback through haptic technology ."
"Multimodal biometric systems use multiple sensors or biometrics to overcome the limitations of unimodal biometric systems . [ 10 ] For instance iris recognition systems can be compromised by aging irises [ 11 ] and electronic fingerprint recognition can be worsened by worn-out or cut fingerprints . While unimodal biometric systems are limited by the integrity of their identifier , it is unlikely that several unimodal systems will suffer from identical limitations . Multimodal biometric systems can obtain sets of information from the same marker ( i.e. , multiple images of an iris , or scans of the same finger ) or information from different biometrics ( requiring fingerprint scans and , using voice recognition , a spoken passcode ) ."
"Biometric identifiers are the distinctive , measurable characteristics used to label and describe individuals . Biometric identifiers are often categorized as physiological versus behavioral characteristics . Physiological characteristics are related to the shape of the body . Examples include , but are not limited to fingerprint , palm veins , face recognition , DNA , palm print , hand geometry , iris recognition , retina and odour/scent . Behavioral characteristics are related to the pattern of behavior of a person , including but not limited to typing rhythm , gait , keystroke , signature , behavioral profiling , and voice . Some researchers have coined the term behaviometrics to describe the latter class of biometrics ."
"Digital scent technology ( or olfactory technology ) is the engineering discipline dealing with olfactory representation . It is a technology to sense , transmit and receive scent-enabled digital media ( such as web pages , video games , movies and music ) . This sensing part of this technology works by using olfactometers and electronic noses ."
An electronic nose is an electronic sensing device intended to detect odors or flavors . The expression `` electronic sensing '' refers to the capability of reproducing human senses using sensor arrays and pattern recognition systems .
"Flexible electronics , also known as flex circuits , is a technology for assembling electronic circuits by mounting electronic devices on flexible plastic substrates , such as polyimide , PEEK or transparent conductive polyester [ 1 ] film . Additionally , flex circuits can be screen printed silver circuits on polyester . Flexible electronic assemblies may be manufactured using identical components used for rigid printed circuit boards , allowing the board to conform to a desired shape , or to flex during its use . An alternative approach to flexible electronics suggests various etching techniques to thin down the traditional silicon substrate to few tens of micrometers to gain reasonable flexibility , referred to as flexible silicon ( ~ 5 mm bending radius ) ."
"Organic light-emitting diodes ( OLEDs ) are normally used instead of a back-light for flexible displays , making a flexible organic light-emitting diode display ."
"A memristor is a non-linear two-terminal electrical component relating electric charge and magnetic flux linkage . It was described and named in 1971 by Leon Chua , completing a theoretical quartet of fundamental electrical components which comprises also the resistor , capacitor and inductor ."
"Molecular electronics is the study and application of molecular building blocks for the fabrication of electronic components . It is an interdisciplinary area that spans physics , chemistry , and materials science . The unifying feature is use of molecular building blocks to fabricate electronic components . Due to the prospect of size reduction in electronics offered by molecular-level control of properties , molecular electronics has generated much excitement . It provides a potential means to extend Moore 's Law beyond the foreseen limits of small-scale conventional silicon integrated circuits ."
"Nanoelectromechanical systems ( NEMS ) are a class of devices integrating electrical and mechanical functionality on the nanoscale . NEMS form the next logical miniaturization step from so-called microelectromechanical systems , or MEMS devices . NEMS typically integrate transistor-like nanoelectronics with mechanical actuators , pumps , or motors , and may thereby form physical , biological , and chemical sensors . The name derives from typical device dimensions in the nanometer range , leading to low mass , high mechanical resonance frequencies , potentially large quantum mechanical effects such as zero point motion , and a high surface-to-volume ratio useful for surface-based sensing mechanisms . [ 2 ] Applications include accelerometers and sensors to detect chemical substances in the air ."
"A solid-state transformer ( SST ) , power electronic transformer ( PET ) , or electronic power transformer is actually an AC-to-AC converter , a type of electric power converter that replaces a conventional transformer used in AC electric power distribution . It is more complex than a conventional transformer operating at utility frequency , but it can be smaller and more efficient than a conventional transformer because it operates at high frequency . The main types are `` true '' AC-to-AC converter ( with no DC stages ) and AC-to-DC-to-DC-to-AC converter ( in which an active rectifier supplies power to a DC-to-DC converter , which supplies power to a power inverter ) . A solid-state transformer usually contains a transformer , inside the AC-to-AC converter or DC-to-DC converter , which provides electrical isolation and carries the full power . This transformer is smaller due to smaller DC-DC inverting stages between transformer coils , which consequently mean smaller transformer coils required to step up or step down voltages . A solid-state transformer can actively regulate voltage and current . Some can convert single-phase power to three-phase power and vice versa . Variations can input or output DC power to reduce the number of conversions , for greater end-to-end efficiency . A Modular Solid-state transformer consists of several high-frequency transformers and is similar to a Multi-level converter . As a complex electronic circuit , it must be designed to withstand lightning and other surges . Solid-state transformer is an emerging technology ."
"Spintronics ( a portmanteau meaning spin transport electronics [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] ) , also known as spin electronics , is the study of the intrinsic spin of the electron and its associated magnetic moment , in addition to its fundamental electronic charge , in solid-state devices . [ 4 ] The field of spintronics concerns spin-charge coupling in metallic systems ; the analogous effects in insulators fall into the field of multiferroics ."
"Spintronics fundamentally differs from traditional electronics in that , in addition to charge state , electron spins are exploited as a further degree of freedom , with implications in the efficiency of data storage and transfer . Spintronic systems are most often realised in dilute magnetic semiconductors ( DMS ) and Heusler alloys and are of particular interest in the field of quantum computing and neuromorphic computing ."

"Gesture recognition is a topic in computer science and language technology with the goal of interpreting human gestures via mathematical algorithms . [ 1 ] Gestures can originate from any bodily motion or state but commonly originate from the face or hand . Current [ when ? ] focuses in the field include emotion recognition from face and hand gesture recognition . Users can use simple gestures to control or interact with devices without physically touching them . Many approaches have been made using cameras and computer vision algorithms to interpret sign language . However , the identification and recognition of posture , gait , proxemics , and human behaviors is also the subject of gesture recognition techniques . [ 2 ] Gesture recognition can be seen as a way for computers to begin to understand human body language , thus building a richer bridge between machines and humans than primitive text user interfaces or even GUIs ( graphical user interfaces ) , which still limit the majority of input to keyboard and mouse and interact naturally without any mechanical devices . Using the concept of gesture recognition , it is possible to point a finger at this point will move accordingly . This could make conventional input on devices such and even redundant ."

"General-purpose computing on graphics processing units ( GPGPU , rarely GPGP ) is the use of a graphics processing unit ( GPU ) , which typically handles computation only for computer graphics , to perform computation in applications traditionally handled by the central processing unit ( CPU ) . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] The use of multiple video cards in one computer , or large numbers of graphics chips , further parallelizes the already parallel nature of graphics processing . [ 5 ] In addition , even a single GPU-CPU framework provides advantages that multiple CPUs on their own do not offer due to the specialization in each chip ."

"Quantum radar is a speculative remote-sensing technology based on quantum-mechanical effects , such as the uncertainty principle or quantum entanglement . Broadly speaking , a quantum radar can be seen as a device working in the microwave range , which exploits quantum features , from the point of view of the radiation source and/or the output detection , and is able to outperform a classical counterpart . One approach is based on the use of input quantum correlations ( in particular , quantum entanglement ) combined with a suitable interferometric quantum detection at the receiver ( strongly related to the protocol of quantum illumination ) . Paving the way for a technologically-viable prototype of a quantum radar involves the resolution of a number of experimental challenges as discussed in some review articles , [ 1 ] [ 2 ] the latter of which pointed out `` inaccurate reporting '' in the media . Current experimental designs seem to be limited to very short ranges , of the order of one meter , [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] suggesting that potential applications might instead be for near-distance surveillance or biomedical scanning ."

"Similarly , fluorescent semiconducting nanosensors may take advantage of fluorescence resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) to achieve optical detection . Quantum dots can be used as donors , and will transfer electronic excitation energy when positioned near acceptor molecules , thus losing their fluorescence . These quantum dots can be functionalized to determine which molecules will bind , upon which fluorescence will be restored . Gold nanoparticle-based optical sensors can be used to detect heavy metals very precisely ; for example , mercury levels as low as 0.49 nanometers ."
"A recent effort towards advancement in nanosensor technology has employed molecular imprinting , which is a technique used to synthesize polymer matrices that act as a receptor in molecular recognition . Analogous to the enzyme-substrate lock and key model , molecular imprinting uses template molecules with functional monomers to form polymer matrices with specific shape corresponding to its target template molecules , thus increasing the selectivity and affinity of the matrices ."

Several drug discovery and pharmaceutical companies are currently utilizing these technologies to not only advance the study of personalised medicine , but also to amplify genetic research ; these companies include Alacris Theranostics , Persomics , Flatiron Health , Novartis , OncoDNA and Foundation Medicine , among others . Alternative multi-target approaches to the traditional approach of `` forward '' transfection library screening can entail reverse transfection or chemogenomics ."
"Whole genome sequencing is ostensibly the process of determining the complete DNA sequence of an organism 's genome at a single time . This entails sequencing all of an organism 's chromosomal DNA as well as DNA contained in the mitochondria and , for plants , in the chloroplast . In practice , genome sequences that are nearly complete are also called whole genome sequences ."
"Whole genome sequencing should not be confused with DNA profiling , which only determines the likelihood that genetic material came from a particular individual or group , and does not contain additional information on genetic relationships , origin or susceptibility to specific diseases . [ 7 ] In addition , whole genome sequencing should not be confused with methods that sequence specific subsets of the genome - such methods include whole exome sequencing ( 1-2 % of the genome ) or SNP genotyping ( < 0.1 % of the genome ) . As of 2017 there were no complete genomes for any mammals , including humans . Between 4 % to 9 % of the human genome , mostly satellite DNA , had not been sequenced ."
"While capillary sequencing was the first approach to successfully sequence a nearly full human genome , it is still too expensive and takes too long for commercial purposes . Since 2005 capillary sequencing has been progressively displaced by high-throughput ( formerly `` next-generation '' ) sequencing technologies such as Illumina dye sequencing , pyrosequencing , and SMRT sequencing . [ 33 ] All of these technologies continue to employ the basic shotgun strategy , namely , parallelization and template generation via genome fragmentation ."
"Other technologies are emerging , including nanopore technology . Though nanopore sequencing technology is still being refined , its portability and potential capability of generating long reads are of relevance to whole-genome sequencing applications ."
Passive immunization is a medical strategy long employed to provide temporary protection against pathogens . Early implementations involved recovering ostensibly cell-free plasma from the blood of human survivors or from non-human animals deliberately exposed to a specific pathogen or toxin . These approaches resulted in crude purifications of plasma-soluble proteins including antibodies .
"Stem-cell therapy has become controversial following developments such as the ability of scientists to isolate and culture embryonic stem cells , to create stem cells using somatic cell nuclear transfer and their use of techniques to create induced pluripotent stem cells . This controversy is often related to abortion politics and to human cloning . Additionally , efforts to market treatments based on transplant of stored umbilical cord blood have been controversial ."
The development of synthetic genomics is related to certain recent technical abilities and technologies in the field of genetics . The ability to construct long base pair chains cheaply and accurately on a large scale has allowed researchers to perform experiments on genomes that do not exist in nature . Coupled with the developments in protein folding models and decreasing computational costs the field synthetic genomics is beginning to enter a productive stage of vitality .
"Vitrification ( from Latin vitreum , `` glass '' via French vitrifier ) is the transformation of a substance into a glass , [ 1 ] that is to say , a non-crystalline amorphous solid . In the production of ceramics , vitrification is responsible for its impermeability to water ."
"A cryoprotectant is a substance used to protect biological tissue from freezing damage ( i.e . that due to ice formation ) . Arctic and Antarctic insects , fish and amphibians create cryoprotectants ( antifreeze compounds and antifreeze proteins ) in their bodies to minimize freezing damage during cold winter periods . Cryoprotectants are also used to preserve living materials in the study of biology and to preserve food products ."
"For years , glycerol has been used in cryobiology as a cryoprotectant for blood cells and bull sperm , allowing storage at liquid nitrogen temperatures . However , glycerol can not be used to protect whole organs from damage . Instead , many biotechnology companies are researching the development of other cryoprotectants more suitable for such uses . A successful discovery may eventually make possible the bulk cryogenic storage ( or `` banking '' ) of transplantable human and xenobiotic organs . A substantial step in that direction has already occurred . Twenty-First Century Medicine has vitrified a rabbit kidney to -135 °C with their proprietary vitrification cocktail . Upon rewarming , the kidney was successfully transplanted into a rabbit , with complete functionality and viability , able to sustain the rabbit indefinitely as the sole functioning kidney ."
