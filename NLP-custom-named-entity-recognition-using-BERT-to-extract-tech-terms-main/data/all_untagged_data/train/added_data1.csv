full-color holographic 3-D display
OPI-based longitudinal-to-lateral depth conversion ( LTL-DC ) scheme
"Three-color off-axis US-CGHs are generated with their center-shifted principle fringe patterns ( CS-PFPs ) of the novel look-up table ( NLUT ) method , where center-shifts are calculated with the derived undersampling conditions of the CGH based on the generalized sampling theorem , and then multiplexed into the color-multiplexed hologram ( CMH ) . The CMH is loaded on a SLM ( spatial light modulator ) and reconstructed by being illuminated with a multi-wavelength light source , where an original full-color image is reconstructed being spatially separated from the other color-dispersed images on the projected image plane with the OPI-based LTL-DC process , which enables us to view the original full-color image just with a simple filter mask . Here it must be noted that in case the calculated CMH is loaded on a SLM and directly reconstructed by being illuminated with the multi-wavelength light source , not only three original color images , but six kinds of color-dispersed images are also reconstructed along the longitudinal direction with their depths due to the CDs ."
"Accordingly , in this paper , a novel type of the compact full-color electro-holographic 3-D display is proposed based on the undersampled computer-generated holograms ( US-CGHs ) and oblique projection imaging ( OPI ) -based longitudinal-to-lateral depth conversion ( LTL-DC ) scheme ."
