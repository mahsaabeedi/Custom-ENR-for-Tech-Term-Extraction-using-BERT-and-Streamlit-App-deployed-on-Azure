"Reproductive cloning generally uses `` somatic cell nuclear transfer '' ( SCNT ) to create animals that are genetically identical . This process entails the transfer of a nucleus from a donor adult cell ( somatic cell ) to an egg from which the nucleus has been removed , or to a cell from a blastocyst from which the nucleus has been removed . [ 23 ] If the egg begins to divide normally it is transferred into the uterus of the surrogate mother . Such clones are not strictly identical since the somatic cells may contain mutations in their nuclear DNA . Additionally , the mitochondria in the cytoplasm also contains DNA and during SCNT this mitochondrial DNA is wholly from the cytoplasmic donor 's egg , thus the mitochondrial genome is not the same as that of the nucleus donor cell from which it was produced . This may have important implications for cross-species nuclear transfer in which nuclear-mitochondrial incompatibilities may lead to death ."
"Molecular cloning is a set of experimental methods in molecular biology that are used to assemble recombinant DNA molecules and to direct their replication within host organisms . [ 1 ] The use of the word cloning refers to the fact that the method involves the replication of one molecule to produce a population of cells with identical DNA molecules . Molecular cloning generally uses DNA sequences from two different organisms : the species that is the source of the DNA to be cloned , and the species that will serve as the living host for replication of the recombinant DNA . Molecular cloning methods are central to many contemporary areas of modern biology and medicine ."
