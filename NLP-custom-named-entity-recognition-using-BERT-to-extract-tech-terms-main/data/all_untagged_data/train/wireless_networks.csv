"A wireless ad hoc network [ 1 ] ( WANET ) or Mobile ad hoc network ( MANET ) is a decentralized type of wireless network . [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] The network is ad hoc because it does not rely on a pre-existing infrastructure , such as routers in wired networks or access points in managed ( infrastructure ) wireless networks . [ 7 ] Instead , each node participates in routing by forwarding data for other nodes , so the determination of which nodes forward data is made dynamically on the basis of network connectivity and the routing algorithm in use ."
"The decentralized nature of wireless ad hoc networks makes them suitable for a variety of applications where central nodes ca n't be relied on and may improve the scalability of networks compared to wireless managed networks , though theoretical and practical limits to the overall capacity of such networks have been identified . Minimal configuration and quick deployment make ad hoc networks suitable for emergency situations like natural disasters or military conflicts . The presence of dynamic and adaptive routing protocols enables ad hoc networks to be formed quickly . Wireless ad hoc networks can be further classified by their applications :"
Mobile ad hoc networks ( MANETs )
"A mobile ad hoc network ( MANET ) is a continuously self-configuring , self-organizing , infrastructure-less [ 22 ] network of mobile devices connected without wires . It is sometimes known as `` on-the-fly '' networks or `` spontaneous networks '' . [ 23 ]"
Vehicular ad hoc networks ( VANETs )
"VANETs are used for communication between vehicles and roadside equipment . [ 24 ] Intelligent vehicular ad hoc networks ( InVANETs ) are a kind of artificial intelligence that helps vehicles to behave in intelligent manners during vehicle-to-vehicle collisions , accidents . Vehicles are using radio waves to communicate with each other , creating communication networks instantly on-the-fly while vehicles move along roads ."
Smartphone ad hoc networks ( SPANs )
"A SPAN leverages existing hardware ( primarily Wi-Fi and Bluetooth ) and software ( protocols ) in commercially available smartphones to create peer-to-peer networks without relying on cellular carrier networks , wireless access points , or traditional network infrastructure . SPANs differ from traditional hub and spoke networks , such as Wi-Fi Direct , in that they support multi-hop relays and there is no notion of a group leader so peers can join and leave at will without destroying the network . Most recently , Apple 's iPhone with version 8.4 iOS and higher have been enabled with multi-peer ad hoc mesh networking capability , [ 25 ] in iPhones , allowing millions of smart phones to create ad hoc networks without relying on cellular communications . It has been claimed that this is going to `` change the world '' . [ 26 ]"
iMANETs
Internet-based mobile ad hoc networks ( iMANETs ) is a type of wireless ad hoc network that supports Internet protocols such as TCP/UDP and IP . The network uses a network-layer routing protocol to link mobile nodes and establish routes distributedly and automatically .
Wireless mesh networks
Main article : Wireless mesh network
"Mesh networks take their name from the topology of the resultant network . In a fully connected mesh , each node is connected to every other node , forming a `` mesh '' . A partial mesh , by contrast , has a topology in which some nodes are not connected to others , although this term is seldom in use . Wireless ad hoc networks can take the form of a mesh networks or others . A wireless ad hoc network does not have fixed topology , and its connectivity among nodes is totally dependent on the behavior of the devices , their mobility patterns , distance with each other , etc . Hence , wireless mesh networks are a particular type of wireless ad hoc networks , with special emphasis on the resultant network topology . While some wireless mesh networks ( particularly those within a home ) have relatively infrequent mobility and thus infrequent link breaks , other more mobile mesh networks require frequent routing adjustments to account for lost links . [ 27 ]"
Army tactical MANETs
"Military or tactical MANETs are used by military units with emphasis on data rate , real-time requirement , fast re-routing during mobility , data security , radio range , and integration with existing systems . [ 28 ] Common radio waveforms include the US Army 's JTRS SRW and Persistent System 's WaveRelay . Ad hoc mobile communications [ 29 ] come in well to fulfill this need , especially its infrastructureless nature , fast deployment and operation . Military MANETs are used by military units with emphasis on rapid deployment , infrastructureless , all-wireless networks ( no fixed radio towers ) , robustness ( link breaks are no problem ) , security , range , and instant operation . MANETs can be used in army `` hopping '' mines , [ 30 ] in platoons where soldiers communicate in foreign terrains , giving them superiority in the battlefield . Tactical MANETs can be formed automatically during the mission and the network `` disappears '' when the mission is over or decommissioned . It is sometimes called `` on-the-fly '' wireless tactical network ."
Air Force UAV Ad hoc networks
"Flying ad hoc networks ( FANETs ) are composed of unmanned aerial vehicles , allowing great mobility and providing connectivity to remote areas . [ 31 ]"
"Unmanned aerial vehicle , is an aircraft with no pilot on board . UAVs can be remotely controlled ( i.e. , flown by a pilot at a ground control station ) or can fly autonomously based on pre-programmed flight plans . Civilian usage of UAV include modeling 3D terrains , package delivery ( Amazon ) , etc . [ 32 ]"
"UAVs have also been used by US Air Force [ 33 ] for data collection and situation sensing , without risking the pilot in a foreign unfriendly environment . With wireless ad hoc network technology embedded into the UAVs , multiple UAVs can communicate with each other and work as a team , collaboratively to complete a task and mission . If a UAV is destroyed by an enemy , its data can be quickly offloaded wirelessly to other neighboring UAVs . The UAV ad hoc communication network is also sometimes referred to UAV instant sky network ."
Navy ad hoc networks
"Navy ships traditionally use satellite communications and other maritime radios to communicate with each other or with ground station back on land . However , such communications are restricted by delays and limited bandwidth . Wireless ad hoc networks enable ship-area-networks to be formed while at sea , enabling high speed wireless communications among ships , enhancing their sharing of imaging and multimedia data , and better co-ordination in battlefield operations . [ 34 ] Some defense companies ( such as Rockwell Collins and Rohde & Schwartz ) have produced products that enhance ship-to-ship and ship-to-shore communications . [ 35 ]"
Wireless sensor networks
"Sensors are useful devices that collect information related to a specific parameter , such as noise , temperature , humidity , pressure , etc . Sensors are increasingly connected via wireless to allow large scale collection of sensor data . With a large sample of sensor data , analytics processing can be used to make sense out of these data . The connectivity of wireless sensor networks rely on the principles behind wireless ad hoc networks , since sensors can now be deploy without any fixed radio towers , and they can now form networks on-the-fly . `` Smart Dust '' was one of the early projects done at U C Berkeley , where tiny radios were used to interconnect smart dust . [ 36 ] More recently , mobile wireless sensor networks ( MWSNs ) have also become an area of academic interest ."
Ad hoc home smart lighting
"ZigBee is a low power form of wireless ad hoc networks that is now finding their way in home automation . Its low power consumption , robustness and extended range inherent in mesh networking can deliver several advantages for smart lighting in homes and in offices . The control includes adjusting dimmable lights , color lights , and color or scene . The networks allow a set or subset of lights to be controlled over a smart phone or via a computer . [ 37 ] The home automation market is tipped to exceed $ 16 billion by 2019 ."
Ad hoc street light networks
"Wireless ad hoc smart street light networks are beginning to evolve . The concept is to use wireless control of city street lights for better energy efficiency , as part of a smart city architectural feature . [ 38 ] Multiple street lights form a wireless ad hoc network . A single gateway device can control up to 500 street lights . Using the gateway device , one can turn individual lights ON , OFF or dim them , as well as find out which individual light is faulty and in need of maintenance . [ 39 ]"
Ad hoc network of robots
"Robots are mechanical systems that drive automation and perform chores that would seem difficult for man . Efforts have been made to co-ordinate and control a group of robots to undertake collaborative work to complete a task . Centralized control is often based on a `` star '' approach , where robots take turns to talk to the controller station . However , with wireless ad hoc networks , robots can form a communication network on-the-fly , i.e. , robots can now `` talk '' to each other and collaborate in a distributed fashion . [ 40 ] With a network of robots , the robots can communicate among themselves , share local information , and distributively decide how to resolve a task in the most effective and efficient way . [ 41 ]"
Disaster rescue ad hoc network
"Another civilian use of wireless ad hoc network is public safety . At times of disasters ( floods , storms , earthquakes , fires , etc . ) , a quick and instant wireless communication network is necessary . Especially at times of earthquakes when radio towers had collapsed or were destroyed , wireless ad hoc networks can be formed independently . Firemen and rescue workers can use ad hoc networks to communicate and rescue those injured . Commercial radios with such capability are available on the market . [ 42 ] [ 43 ]"
Hospital ad hoc network
"Wireless ad hoc networks allow sensors , videos , instruments , and other devices to be deployed and interconnected wirelessly for clinic and hospital patient monitoring , doctor and nurses alert notification , and also making senses of such data quickly at fusion points , so that lives can be saved . [ 44 ] [ 45 ]"
Data monitoring and mining
"MANETS can be used for facilitating the collection of sensor data for data mining for a variety of applications such as air pollution monitoring and different types of architectures can be used for such applications . [ 46 ] A key characteristic of such applications is that nearby sensor nodes monitoring an environmental feature typically register similar values . This kind of data redundancy due to the spatial correlation between sensor observations inspires the techniques for in-network data aggregation and mining . By measuring the spatial correlation between data sampled by different sensors , a wide class of specialized algorithms can be developed to develop more efficient spatial data mining algorithms as well as more efficient routing strategies . [ 47 ] Also , researchers have developed performance models for MANET to apply queueing theory ."
"With a time evolving network it is clear we should expect variations in network performance due to no fixed architecture ( no fixed connections ) . Furthermore , since network topology determines interference and thus connectivity , the mobility pattern of devices within the network will impact on network performance , possibly resulting in data having to be resent a lot of times ( increased delay ) and finally allocation of network resources such as power remains unclear . [ 53 ] Finally , finding a model that accurately represents human mobility whilst remaining mathematically tractable remains an open problem due to the large range of factors that influence it . [ 56 ] Some typical models used include the random walk , random waypoint and levy flight models ."
"Wireless ad hoc networks can operate over different types of radios . All radios use modulation to move information over a certain bandwidth of radio frequencies . Given the need to move large amounts of information quickly over long distances , a MANET radio channel ideally has large bandwidth ( e.g . amount of radio spectrum ) , lower frequencies , and higher power . Given the desire to communicate with many other nodes ideally simultaneously , many channels are needed . Given radio spectrum is shared and regulated , there is less bandwidth available at lower frequencies . Processing many radio channels requires many resources . Given the need for mobility , small size and lower power consumption are very important . Picking a MANET radio and modulation has many trade-offs ; many start with the specific frequency and bandwidth they are allowed to use ."
"Radios can be UHF ( 300 – 3000 MHz ) , SHF ( 3 – 30 GHz ) , and EHF ( 30 – 300 GHz ) . Wi-Fi ad hoc uses the unlicensed ISM 2.4 GHz radios . They can also be used on 5.8 GHz radios ."
"The higher the frequency , such as those of 300 GHz , absorption of the signal will be more predominant . Army tactical radios usually employ a variety of UHF and SHF radios , including those of VHF to provide a variety of communication modes . At the 800 , 900 , 1200 , 1800 MHz range , cellular radios are predominant . Some cellular radios use ad hoc communications to extend cellular range to areas and devices not reachable by the cellular base station ."
"Next generation Wi-Fi known as 802.11ax provides low delay , high capacity ( up to 10Gbit/s ) and low packet loss rate , offering 12 streams – 8 streams at 5 GHz and 4 streams at 2.4 GHz . IEEE 802.11ax uses 8x8 MU-MIMO , OFDMA , and 80 MHz channels . Hence , 802.11ax has the ability to form high capacity Wi-Fi ad hoc networks ."
"At 60 GHz , there is another form of Wi-Fi known as WiGi – wireless gigabit . This has the ability to offer up to 7Gbit/s throughput . Currently , WiGi is targeted to work with 5G cellular networks . [ 61 ]"
"Circa 2020 , the general consensus finds the 'best ' modulation for moving information over higher frequency waves to be Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing , as used in 4G LTE , 5G , and Wi-Fi ."
Cross-layer interaction and service mapping ( CLIASM ) was designed for achieving QoS for wireless network .
"P. Venkata Krishna et al. , proposed a cross-layer QoS model called CLIASM for MANET . This model proposes a back and forth flow mechanism for sharing information . A shared database is being utilized to enable layers share information though each layer is performing different function . Between two layers two interfaces are created to enable flow of information on both sides . The model is implemented based on the division of network features according to layers as application layer metrics ( ALM ) , transport layer metrics ( TLM ) , network layer metrics ( NLM ) and MAC layer metrics ( MLM ) . But in deploying several cross-layering approaches , one has to keep in mind the possibilities of occurrence of unintended interactions and side effects . Conflicting interactions may create stability problems and result performance degradation ."
"Delay-tolerant networking ( DTN ) is an approach to computer network architecture that seeks to address the technical issues in heterogeneous networks that may lack continuous network connectivity . Examples of such networks are those operating in mobile or extreme terrestrial environments , or planned networks in space ."
"Recently , the term disruption-tolerant networking has gained currency in the United States due to support from DARPA , which has funded many DTN projects . Disruption may occur because of the limits of wireless radio range , sparsity of mobile nodes , energy resources , attack , and noise ."
"A mobile wireless sensor network ( MWSN ) [ 1 ] can simply be defined as a wireless sensor network ( WSN ) in which the sensor nodes are mobile . MWSNs are a smaller , emerging field of research in contrast to their well-established predecessor . MWSNs are much more versatile than static sensor networks as they can be deployed in any scenario and cope with rapid topology changes . However , many of their applications are similar , such as environment monitoring or surveillance . Commonly , the nodes consist of a radio transceiver and a microcontroller powered by a battery , as well as some kind of sensor for detecting light , heat , humidity , temperature , etc ."
"Broadly speaking , there are two sets of challenges in MWSNs ; hardware and environment . The main hardware constraints are limited battery power and low cost requirements . The limited power means that it 's important for the nodes to be energy efficient . Price limitations often demand low complexity algorithms for simpler microcontrollers and use of only a simplex radio . The major environmental factors are the shared medium and varying topology . The shared medium dictates that channel access must be regulated in some way . This is often done using a medium access control ( MAC ) scheme , such as carrier sense multiple access ( CSMA ) , frequency division multiple access ( FDMA ) or code division multiple access ( CDMA ) . The varying topology of the network comes from the mobility of nodes , which means that multihop paths from the sensors to the sink are not stable ."
"Currently there is no standard for MWSNs , so often protocols from MANETs are borrowed , such as Associativity-Based Routing ( AR ) , Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector Routing ( AODV ) , Dynamic Source Routing ( DSR ) and Greedy Perimeter Stateless Routing ( GPSR ) . [ 2 ] MANET protocols are preferred as they are able to work in mobile environments , whereas WSN protocols often are n't suitable ."
"The advantage of allowing the sensors to be mobile increases the number of applications beyond those for which static WSNs are used . In order to characterise the requirements of an application , it can be categorised as either constant monitoring , event monitoring , constant mapping or event mapping . [ 1 ] Constant type applications are time-based and as such data is generated periodically , whereas event type applications are event drive and so data is only generated when an event occurs . The monitoring applications are constantly running over a period of time , whereas mapping applications are usually deployed once in order to assess the current state of a phenomenon . Examples of applications include health monitoring , which may include heart rate , blood pressure etc . [ 13 ] This can be constant , in the case of a patient in a hospital , or event driven in the case of a wearable sensor that automatically reports your location to an ambulance team in the case of an emergency . Animals can have sensors attached to them in order to track their movements for migration patterns , feeding habits or other research purposes . [ 14 ] Sensors may also be attached to unmanned aerial vehicles ( UAVs ) for surveillance or environment mapping . [ 15 ] In the case of autonomous UAV aided search and rescue , this would be considered an event mapping application , since the UAVs are deployed to search an area but will only transmit data back when a person has been found ."
"Wireless sensor network ( WSN ) refers to a group of spatially dispersed and dedicated sensors for monitoring and recording the physical conditions of the environment and organizing the collected data at a central location . WSNs measure environmental conditions like temperature , sound , pollution levels , humidity , wind , and so on ."
"Bluetooth Mesh is a computer mesh networking standard based on Bluetooth Low Energy that allows for many-to-many communication over Bluetooth radio . The Bluetooth Mesh specifications were defined in the Mesh Profile [ 1 ] and Mesh Model [ 2 ] specifications by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group ( Bluetooth SIG ) . Bluetooth Mesh was conceived in 2014 [ 3 ] and adopted on July 13 , 2017 ."
"Optical wireless communications ( OWC ) is a form of optical communication in which unguided visible , infrared ( IR ) , or ultraviolet ( UV ) light is used to carry a signal ."
Variations of OWC can be potentially employed in a diverse range of communication applications ranging from optical interconnects within integrated circuits through outdoor inter-building links to satellite communications .
"OWC can be divided into five categories based on the transmission range : 1 . Ultra-short range : chip-to-chip communications in stacked and closely packed multi-chip packages . 2 . Short range : wireless body area network ( WBAN ) and wireless personal area network ( WPAN ) applications under standard IEEE 802.15.7 , underwater communications . 3.Medium range : indoor IR and visible light communications ( VLC ) for wireless local area networks ( WLANs ) and inter-vehicular and vehicle-to-infrastructure communications . 4 . Long range : inter-building connections , also called free-space optical communications ( FSO ) . 5 . Ultra-long range : Laser communication in space especially for inter-satellite links and establishment of satellite constellations ."
"OWC systems operating in the visible band ( 390–750 nm ) are commonly referred to as visible light communication ( VLC ) . VLC systems take advantage of light emitting diodes ( LEDs ) which can be pulsed at very high speeds without noticeable effect on the lighting output and human eye . VLC can be possibly used in a wide range of applications including wireless local area networks , wireless personal area networks and vehicular networks among others . On the other hand , terrestrial point-to-point OWC systems , also known as the free space optical ( FSO ) systems , operate at the near IR frequencies ( 750–1600 nm ) . These systems typically use laser transmitters and offer a cost-effective protocol-transparent link with high data rates , i.e. , 10 Gbit/s per wavelength , and provide a potential solution for the backhaul bottleneck . There has also been a growing interest on ultraviolet communication ( UVC ) as a result of recent progress in solid state optical sources/detectors operating within solar-blind UV spectrum ( 200–280 nm ) . In this so-called deep UV band , solar radiation is negligible at the ground level and this makes possible the design of photon-counting detectors with wide field-of-view receivers that increase the received energy with little additional background noise . Such designs are particularly useful for outdoor non-line-of-sight configurations to support low power short-range UVC such as in wireless sensor and ad-hoc networks ."
"A virtual sensor network ( VSN ) is an emerging form of collaborative wireless sensor networks . [ 1 ] In contrast to early wireless sensor networks that were dedicated to a specific application ( e.g. , target tracking ) , VSNs enable multi-purpose , collaborative , and resource efficient WSNs . The key idea difference of VSNs is the collaboration and resource sharing . By doing so nodes achieve application objectives in a more resource efficient way . These networks may further involve dynamically varying subset of sensor nodes ( e.g. , when the phenomenon migrates sensors that detect the phenomenon changes with time ) and/or users ( users that are accessing the network changes with time ) ."
"A personal area network ( PAN ) is a computer network for interconnecting electronic devices centered on an individual person 's workspace . [ 1 ] A PAN provides data transmission among devices such as computers , smartphones , tablets and personal digital assistants . PANs can be used for communication among the personal devices themselves , or for connecting to a higher level network and the Internet where one master device takes up the role as gateway . A PAN may be wireless or carried over wired interfaces such as USB ."
"A wireless personal area network ( WPAN ) is a PAN carried over a low-powered , short-distance wireless network technology such as IrDA , Wireless USB , Bluetooth or ZigBee . The reach of a WPAN varies from a few centimeters to a few meters ."
"An Internet area network ( IAN ) is a concept for a communications network [ 1 ] that connects voice and data endpoints within a cloud environment over IP , replacing an existing local area network ( LAN ) , wide area network ( WAN ) or the public switched telephone network ( PSTN ) ."
"A nanonetwork or nanoscale network is a set of interconnected nanomachines ( devices a few hundred nanometers or a few micrometers at most in size ) , which are able to perform only very simple tasks such as computing , data storing , sensing and actuation . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] Nanonetworks are expected to expand the capabilities of single nanomachines both in terms of complexity and range of operation by allowing them to coordinate , share and fuse information . Nanonetworks enable new applications of nanotechnology in the biomedical field , environmental research , military technology and industrial and consumer goods applications . Nanoscale communication is defined in IEEE P1906.1 ."
Near-Field Communication ( NFC ) is a set of communication protocols for communication between two electronic devices over a distance of 4 cm ( 1 ? 1/2 in ) or less . [ 1 ] NFC offers a low-speed connection with simple setup that can be used to bootstrap more-capable wireless connections . [ 2 ]
"NFC devices can act as electronic identity documents and keycards . [ 2 ] They are used in contactless payment systems and allow mobile payment replacing or supplementing systems such as credit cards and electronic ticket smart cards . This is sometimes called NFC/CTLS or CTLS NFC , with contactless abbreviated CTLS . NFC can be used for sharing small files such as contacts , and bootstrapping fast connections to share larger media such as photos , videos , and other files ."
"A body area network ( BAN ) , also referred to as a wireless body area network ( WBAN ) or a body sensor network ( BSN ) or a medical body area network ( MBAN ) , is a wireless network of wearable computing devices . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] BAN devices may be embedded inside the body as implants , may be surface-mounted on the body in a fixed position , or may be accompanied devices which humans can carry in different positions , such as in clothes pockets , by hand , or in various bags . [ 6 ] While there is a trend towards the miniaturization of devices , in particular , body area networks consist of several miniaturized body sensor units ( BSUs ) together with a single body central unit ( BCU ) , [ 7 ] larger decimeter ( tab and pad ) sized smart devices still play an important role in terms of acting as a data hub or data gateway and providing a user interface to view and manage BAN applications , in-situ . The development of WBAN technology started around 1995 around the idea of using wireless personal area network ( WPAN ) technologies to implement communications on , near , and around the human body . About six years later , the term `` BAN '' came to refer to systems where communication is entirely within , on , and in the immediate proximity of a human body . [ 8 ] [ 9 ] A WBAN system can use WPAN wireless technologies as gateways to reach longer ranges . Through gateway devices , it is possible to connect the wearable devices on the human body to the internet . This way , medical professionals can access patient data online using the internet independent of the patient location ."
A near-me area network ( NAN ) is a communication network that focuses on wireless communication among devices in close proximity .
"Unlike local area networks ( LANs ) , where the devices are in the same network segment and share the same broadcast domain , the devices in a NAN can belong to different proprietary network infrastructures ( for example , different mobile carriers ) . If two devices are geographically close , the communication path between them might , in fact , traverse a long distance , going from a LAN , through the Internet , and to another LAN . [ 1 ] [ citation needed ]"
"NAN applications focus on two-way communications among devices within a certain proximity to each other , but do n't generally concern themselves with the devices ' exact locations ."
"A local area network ( LAN ) is a computer network that interconnects computers within a limited area such as a residence , school , laboratory , university campus or office building . [ 1 ] By contrast , a wide area network ( WAN ) not only covers a larger geographic distance , but also generally involves leased telecommunication circuits ."
"Ethernet and Wi-Fi are the two most common technologies in use for local area networks . Historical network technologies include ARCNET , Token Ring , and AppleTalk ."
"A home network or home area network ( HAN ) is a type of computer network that facilitates communication among devices within the close vicinity of a home . Devices capable of participating in this network , for example , smart devices such as network printers and handheld mobile computers , often gain enhanced emergent capabilities through their ability to interact . These additional capabilities can be used to increase the quality of life inside the home in a variety of ways , such as automation of repetitive tasks , increased personal productivity , enhanced home security , and easier access to entertainment ."
"A storage area network ( SAN ) or storage network is a computer network which provides access to consolidated , block-level data storage . SANs are primarily used to access storage devices , such as disk arrays and tape libraries from servers so that the devices appear to the operating system as direct-attached storage . A SAN typically is a dedicated network of storage devices not accessible through the local area network ( LAN ) ."
"Although a SAN provides only block-level access , file systems built on top of SANs do provide file-level access and are known as shared-disk file systems ."
"A wireless LAN ( WLAN ) is a wireless computer network that links two or more devices using wireless communication to form a local area network ( LAN ) within a limited area such as a home , school , computer laboratory , campus , or office building . This gives users the ability to move around within the area and remain connected to the network . Through a gateway , a WLAN can also provide a connection to the wider Internet ."
Most modern WLANs are based on IEEE 802.11 standards and are marketed under the Wi-Fi brand name .
"Wireless LANs have become popular for use in the home , due to their ease of installation and use . They are also popular in commercial properties that offer wireless access to their employees and customers ."
"A campus network , campus area network , corporate area network or CAN is a computer network made up of an interconnection of local area networks ( LANs ) within a limited geographical area . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] The networking equipments ( switches , routers ) and transmission media ( optical fiber , copper plant , Cat5 cabling etc . ) are almost entirely owned by the campus tenant / owner : an enterprise , university , government etc . [ 3 ] A campus area network is larger than a local area network but smaller than a metropolitan area network ( MAN ) or wide area network ( WAN ) ."
A metropolitan area network ( MAN ) is a computer network that interconnects users with computer resources in a geographic region of the size of a metropolitan area . The term MAN is applied to the interconnection of local area networks ( LANs ) in a city into a single larger network which may then also offer efficient connection to a wide area network . The term is also used to describe the interconnection of several local area networks in a metropolitan area through the use of point-to-point connections between them .
"A municipal wireless network is a citywide wireless network . This usually works by providing municipal broadband via Wi-Fi to large parts or all of a municipal area by deploying a wireless mesh network . The typical deployment design uses hundreds of wireless access points deployed outdoors , often on poles . The operator of the network acts as a wireless internet service provider ."
