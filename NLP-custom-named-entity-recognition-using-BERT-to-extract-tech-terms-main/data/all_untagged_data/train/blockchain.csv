The blockchain was invented by a person ( or group of people ) using the name Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 to serve as the public transaction ledger of the cryptocurrency bitcoin . [ 1 ] The identity of Satoshi Nakamoto remains unknown to date . The invention of the blockchain for bitcoin made it the first digital currency to solve the double-spending problem without the need of a trusted authority or central server . The bitcoin design has inspired other applications [ 1 ] [ 3 ] and blockchains that are readable by the public and are widely used by cryptocurrencies . The blockchain is considered a type of payment rail . [ 8 ] Private blockchains have been proposed for business use but Computerworld called the marketing of such privatized blockchains without a proper security model `` snake oil '' . [ 9 ]
"For use as a distributed ledger , a blockchain is typically managed by a peer-to-peer network collectively adhering to a protocol for inter-node communication and validating new blocks . Although blockchain records are not unalterable , blockchains may be considered secure by design and exemplify a distributed computing system with high Byzantine fault tolerance . The blockchain has been described as `` an open , distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way '' . [ 7 ]"
"A blockchain is a decentralized , distributed , and oftentimes public , digital ledger consisting of records called blocks that is used to record transactions across many computers so that any involved block can not be altered retroactively , without the alteration of all subsequent blocks . [ 1 ] [ 17 ] This allows the participants to verify and audit transactions independently and relatively inexpensively . [ 18 ] A blockchain database is managed autonomously using a peer-to-peer network and a distributed timestamping server . They are authenticated by mass collaboration powered by collective self-interests . [ 19 ] Such a design facilitates robust workflow where participants ' uncertainty regarding data security is marginal . The use of a blockchain removes the characteristic of infinite reproducibility from a digital asset . It confirms that each unit of value was transferred only once , solving the long-standing problem of double spending . A blockchain has been described as a value-exchange protocol . [ 20 ] A blockchain can maintain title rights because , when properly set up to detail the exchange agreement , it provides a record that compels offer and acceptance ."
"Blocks hold batches of valid transactions that are hashed and encoded into a Merkle tree . [ 1 ] Each block includes the cryptographic hash of the prior block in the blockchain , linking the two . The linked blocks form a chain . [ 1 ] This iterative process confirms the integrity of the previous block , all the way back to the initial block , which is known as the genesis block ."
"Sometimes separate blocks can be produced concurrently , creating a temporary fork . In addition to a secure hash-based history , any blockchain has a specified algorithm for scoring different versions of the history so that one with a higher score can be selected over others . Blocks not selected for inclusion in the chain are called orphan blocks . [ 21 ] Peers supporting the database have different versions of the history from time to time . They keep only the highest-scoring version of the database known to them . Whenever a peer receives a higher-scoring version ( usually the old version with a single new block added ) they extend or overwrite their own database and retransmit the improvement to their peers . There is never an absolute guarantee that any particular entry will remain in the best version of the history forever . Blockchains are typically built to add the score of new blocks onto old blocks and are given incentives to extend with new blocks rather than overwrite old blocks . Therefore , the probability of an entry becoming superseded decreases exponentially [ 22 ] as more blocks are built on top of it , eventually becoming very low. [ 1 ] [ 23 ] : ch . 08 [ 24 ] For example , bitcoin uses a proof-of-work system , where the chain with the most cumulative proof-of-work is considered the valid one by the network . There are a number of methods that can be used to demonstrate a sufficient level of computation . Within a blockchain the computation is carried out redundantly rather than in the traditional segregated and parallel manner ."
"The block time is the average time it takes for the network to generate one extra block in the blockchain . Some blockchains create a new block as frequently as every five seconds . [ 26 ] By the time of block completion , the included data becomes verifiable . In cryptocurrency , this is practically when the transaction takes place , so a shorter block time means faster transactions . The block time for Ethereum is set to between 14 and 15 seconds , while for bitcoin it is on average 10 minutes ."
"A hard fork is a rule change such that the software validating according to the old rules will see the blocks produced according to the new rules as invalid . In case of a hard fork , all nodes meant to work in accordance with the new rules need to upgrade their software ."
"If one group of nodes continues to use the old software while the other nodes use the new software , a permanent split can occur . For example , Ethereum has hard-forked to `` make whole '' the investors in The DAO , which had been hacked by exploiting a vulnerability in its code . In this case , the fork resulted in a split creating Ethereum and Ethereum Classic chains . In 2014 the Nxt community was asked to consider a hard fork that would have led to a rollback of the blockchain records to mitigate the effects of a theft of 50 million NXT from a major cryptocurrency exchange . The hard fork proposal was rejected , and some of the funds were recovered after negotiations and ransom payment . Alternatively , to prevent a permanent split , a majority of nodes using the new software may return to the old rules , as was the case of bitcoin split on 12 March 2013 . [ 28 ]"
"Peer-to-peer blockchain networks lack centralized points of vulnerability that computer crackers can exploit ; likewise , it has no central point of failure . Blockchain security methods include the use of public-key cryptography . [ 4 ] :5 A public key ( a long , random-looking string of numbers ) is an address on the blockchain . Value tokens sent across the network are recorded as belonging to that address . A private key is like a password that gives its owner access to their digital assets or the means to otherwise interact with the various capabilities that blockchains now support . Data stored on the blockchain is generally considered incorruptible . [ 1 ]"
"Every node in a decentralized system has a copy of the blockchain . Data quality is maintained by massive database replication [ 29 ] and computational trust . No centralized `` official '' copy exists and no user is `` trusted '' more than any other . [ 4 ] Transactions are broadcast to the network using software . Messages are delivered on a best-effort basis . Mining nodes validate transactions , [ 21 ] add them to the block they are building , and then broadcast the completed block to other nodes. [ 23 ] : ch . 08 Blockchains use various time-stamping schemes , such as proof-of-work , to serialize changes . [ 30 ] Alternative consensus methods include proof-of-stake . [ 21 ] Growth of a decentralized blockchain is accompanied by the risk of centralization because the computer resources required to process larger amounts of data become more expensive . [ 31 ]"
"Open blockchains are more user-friendly than some traditional ownership records , which , while open to the public , still require physical access to view . Because all early blockchains were permissionless , controversy has arisen over the blockchain definition . An issue in this ongoing debate is whether a private system with verifiers tasked and authorized ( permissioned ) by a central authority should be considered a blockchain . [ 32 ] [ 33 ] [ 34 ] [ 35 ] [ 36 ] Proponents of permissioned or private chains argue that the term `` blockchain '' may be applied to any data structure that batches data into time-stamped blocks . These blockchains serve as a distributed version of multiversion concurrency control ( MVCC ) in databases . [ 37 ] Just as MVCC prevents two transactions from concurrently modifying a single object in a database , blockchains prevent two transactions from spending the same single output in a blockchain . [ 38 ] :30–31 Opponents say that permissioned systems resemble traditional corporate databases , not supporting decentralized data verification , and that such systems are not hardened against operator tampering and revision . [ 32 ] [ 34 ] Nikolai Hampton of Computerworld said that `` many in-house blockchain solutions will be nothing more than cumbersome databases , '' and `` without a clear security model , proprietary blockchains should be eyed with suspicion . `` [ 9 ] [ 39 ]"
"The great advantage to an open , permissionless , or public , blockchain network is that guarding against bad actors is not required and no access control is needed . [ 22 ] This means that applications can be added to the network without the approval or trust of others , using the blockchain as a transport layer . [ 22 ]"
"Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies currently secure their blockchain by requiring new entries to include a proof of work . To prolong the blockchain , bitcoin uses Hashcash puzzles . While Hashcash was designed in 1997 by Adam Back , the original idea was first proposed by Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor and Eli Ponyatovski in their 1992 paper `` Pricing via Processing or Combatting Junk Mail '' ."
"In 2016 , venture capital investment for blockchain-related projects was weakening in the USA but increasing in China . [ 40 ] Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies use open ( public ) blockchains . As of April 2018 , bitcoin has the highest market capitalization ."
"Permissioned blockchains use an access control layer to govern who has access to the network . [ 41 ] In contrast to public blockchain networks , validators on private blockchain networks are vetted by the network owner . They do not rely on anonymous nodes to validate transactions nor do they benefit from the network effect . [ citation needed ] Permissioned blockchains can also go by the name of 'consortium ' blockchains . [ citation needed ]"
"Nikolai Hampton pointed out in Computerworld that `` There is also no need for a '51 percent ' attack on a private blockchain , as the private blockchain ( most likely ) already controls 100 percent of all block creation resources . If you could attack or damage the blockchain creation tools on a private corporate server , you could effectively control 100 percent of their network and alter transactions however you wished . `` [ 9 ] This has a set of particularly profound adverse implications during a financial crisis or debt crisis like the financial crisis of 2007–08 , where politically powerful actors may make decisions that favor some groups at the expense of others , [ 42 ] [ 43 ] and `` the bitcoin blockchain is protected by the massive group mining effort . It 's unlikely that any private blockchain will try to protect records using gigawatts of computing power — it 's time consuming and expensive . `` [ 9 ] He also said , `` Within a private blockchain there is also no 'race ' ; there 's no incentive to use more power or discover blocks faster than competitors . This means that many in-house blockchain solutions will be nothing more than cumbersome databases . `` [ 9 ]"
"The analysis of public blockchains has become increasingly important with the popularity of bitcoin , Ethereum , litecoin and other cryptocurrencies . [ 44 ] A blockchain , if it is public , provides anyone who wants access to observe and analyse the chain data , given one has the know-how . The process of understanding and accessing the flow of crypto has been an issue for many cryptocurrencies , crypto-exchanges and banks . [ 45 ] [ 46 ] The reason for this is accusations of blockchain enabled cryptocurrencies enabling illicit dark market trade of drugs , weapons , money laundering etc . [ 47 ] A common belief has been that cryptocurrency is private and untraceable , thus leading many actors to use it for illegal purposes . This is changing and now specialised tech-companies provide blockchain tracking services , making crypto exchanges , law-enforcement and banks more aware of what is happening with crypto funds and fiat crypto exchanges . The development , some argue , has led criminals to prioritise use of new cryptos such as Monero . [ 48 ] [ 49 ] [ 50 ] The question is about public accessibility of blockchain data and the personal privacy of the very same data . It is a key debate in cryptocurrency and ultimately in blockchain ."
"Blockchain technology can be integrated into multiple areas . The primary use of blockchains today is as a distributed ledger for cryptocurrencies , most notably bitcoin . There are a few operational products maturing from proof of concept by late 2016 . [ 40 ] Businesses have been thus far reluctant to place blockchain at the core of the business structure . [ 52 ]"
"Most cryptocurrencies use blockchain technology to record transactions . For example , the bitcoin network and Ethereum network are both based on blockchain . On 8 May 2018 Facebook confirmed that it would open a new blockchain group [ 53 ] which would be headed by David Marcus , who previously was in charge of Messenger . Facebook 's planned cryptocurrency platform , Libra ( now known as Diem ) , was formally announced on June 18 , 2019 ."
Blockchain-based smart contracts are proposed contracts that can be partially or fully executed or enforced without human interaction . [ 56 ] One of the main objectives of a smart contract is automated escrow . A key feature of smart contracts is that they do not need a trusted third party ( such as a trustee ) to act as an intermediary between contracting entities -the blockchain network executes the contract on its own . This may reduce friction between entities when transferring value and could subsequently open the door to a higher level of transaction automation . [ 57 ] An IMF staff discussion reported that smart contracts based on blockchain technology might reduce moral hazards and optimize the use of contracts in general . But `` no viable smart contract systems have yet emerged . '' Due to the lack of widespread use their legal status is unclear .
"Major portions of the financial industry are implementing distributed ledgers for use in banking , [ 60 ] [ 61 ] [ 62 ] and according to a September 2016 IBM study , this is occurring faster than expected . [ 63 ]"
Banks are interested in this technology because it has potential to speed up back office settlement systems . [ 64 ]
Banks such as UBS are opening new research labs dedicated to blockchain technology in order to explore how blockchain can be used in financial services to increase efficiency and reduce costs . [ 65 ] [ 66 ]
"Berenberg , a German bank , believes that blockchain is an `` overhyped technology '' that has had a large number of `` proofs of concept '' , but still has major challenges , and very few success stories . [ 67 ]"
"In December 2018 , Bitwala launched Europe 's first regulated blockchain banking solution that enables users to manage both their bitcoin and euro deposits in one place with the safety and convenience of a German bank account . The bank account is hosted by the Berlin-based solarisBank . [ 68 ]"
Mojaloop is designed to deliver financial support to people living in areas underserved by banks . It of use to migrants sending remittances [ 69 ]
"The blockchain has also given rise to Initial coin offerings ( ICOs ) as well as a new category of digital asset called Security Token Offerings ( STOs ) , also sometimes referred to as Digital Security Offerings ( DSOs ) . [ 70 ] STO/DSOs may be conducted privately or on a public , regulated stock exchange and are used to tokenize traditional assets such as company shares as well as more innovative ones like intellectual property , real estate , art , or individual products . A number of companies are active in this space providing services for compliant tokenization , private STOs , and public STOs ."
"A blockchain game CryptoKitties , launched in November 2017 . [ 71 ] The game made headlines in December 2017 when a cryptokitty character - an in-game virtual pet - was sold for more than US $ 100,000 . [ 72 ] CryptoKitties illustrated scalability problems for games on Ethereum when it created significant congestion on the Ethereum network with about 30 % of all Ethereum transactions being for the game . [ 73 ]"
CryptoKitties also demonstrated how blockchains can be used to catalog game assets ( digital assets ) .
Blockchain is also being used in peer-to-peer energy trading .
"Mining — Blockchain technology allows wholesalers , retailers , and customers to track the origins of gems stones and other precious commodities . In 2016 , The Wall Street Journal reported that the blockchain technology company , Everledger was partnering with IBM 's blockchain-based tracking service to trace the origin of diamonds to insure that they were ethically mined . [ 78 ] DTC , the Diamond Trading Company has been involved in building a diamond trading supply chain product called Tracr . [ 79 ]"
"Food supply — Blockchain technology is being used to allow retailers and consumers to track the provenance of meat and other food products from their origins to stores and restaurants . [ 80 ] Walmart and IBM are running a trial to use a blockchain-backed system for supply chain monitoring for lettuce and spinach — all nodes of the blockchain are administered by Walmart and are located on the IBM cloud . [ 81 ] One cited benefit is that the system will enable rapid tracing of contaminated produce . Fogo de Chao , a Brazilian themed restaurant chain that features grilled meats , announced a partnership with HerdX , a blockchain-tech company focused on the food industry , that will enable suppliers , wholesalers , and diners to trace the beef served in Fogo de Chao restaurants back to the farm where it was raised . [ 82 ] Some analysts are less convinced that most consumers will be that interested in this capability . [ 79 ]"
"Shipping Walmart Canada uses a blockchain-based system developed by DLT Labs , a blockchain SaaS provider , that allows the retailer to track shipments and deliveries handled by dozens of third-party trucking companies . One reported benefit is that the blockchain-based system enables automated invoicing that reduces disputed billing , which in turn reduces delays in Walmart paying the freight transport companies . [ 83 ]"
"Blockchain software development — The Linux Foundation 's blockchain initiative , Hyperledger Grid develops open components for blockchain supply chain solutions . [ 84 ] [ 85 ] The goal of the project , said the foundation , was to `` accelerate the development of blockchain-based solutions to cross-industry supply chain problems . ''"
Anti-counterfeiting
"Blockchain could be used in detecting counterfeits by associating unique identifiers to products , documents and shipments , and storing records associated to transactions that can not be forged or altered . [ 86 ] [ 87 ] It is however argued that blockchain technology needs to be supplemented with technologies that provide a strong binding between physical objects and blockchain systems . [ 88 ] The EUIPO established an Anti-Counterfeiting Blockathon Forum , with the objective of `` defining , piloting and implementing '' an anti-counterfeiting infrastructure at the European level . [ 89 ] [ 90 ] The Dutch Standardisation organisation NEN uses blockchain together with QR Codes to authenticate certificates . [ 91 ]"
Health Care
"In response to the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic , The Wall Street Journal reported that Ernst & Young was working on a blockchain to help employers , governments , airlines and others keep track of people who have had antibody tests and could be immune to the virus . Hospitals and vendors also utilized a blockchain for needed medical equipment . Additionally , blockchain technology was being used in China to speed up the time it takes for health insurance payments to be paid to health-care providers and patients . [ 92 ]"
Domain Names
"Blockchain domain names are another use of blockchain on the rise . Unlike regular domain names , blockchain domain names are entirely an asset of the domain owner and can only be controlled by the owner through a private key . [ 93 ] Blockchain domains pave the way to having sites that are more resistant to censorship and thus enable freedom of speech as there are no authorities or individuals that can intervene on controlling a domain except the private key holder . [ 94 ] [ 95 ] They could be a better option to replace the traditional cryptocurrency wallet addresses as one can easily memorize the domain and use it for receiving payments . [ 96 ]"
"Organizations providing blockchain domain name services include Unstoppable Domains , Namecoin and Ethereum Name Services . [ 97 ]"
Other uses
"Blockchain technology can be used to create a permanent , public , transparent ledger system for compiling data on sales , tracking digital use and payments to content creators , such as wireless users [ 98 ] or musicians . [ 99 ] In 2017 , IBM partnered with ASCAP and PRS for Music to adopt blockchain technology in music distribution . [ 100 ] Imogen Heap 's Mycelia service has also been proposed as blockchain-based alternative `` that gives artists more control over how their songs and associated data circulate among fans and other musicians . `` [ 101 ] [ 102 ]"
"New distribution methods are available for the insurance industry such as peer-to-peer insurance , parametric insurance and microinsurance following the adoption of blockchain . [ 103 ] [ 104 ] The sharing economy and IoT are also set to benefit from blockchains because they involve many collaborating peers . [ 105 ] Online voting is another application of the blockchain . [ 106 ] [ 107 ] The use of blockchain in libraries is being studied with a grant from the U.S. Institute of Museum and Library Services ."
"Hyperledger is a cross-industry collaborative effort from the Linux Foundation to support blockchain-based distributed ledgers , with projects under this initiative including Hyperledger Burrow ( by Monax ) and Hyperledger Fabric ( spearheaded by IBM ) . [ 109 ]"
"Quorum – a permissionable private blockchain by JPMorgan Chase with private storage , used for contract applications . [ 110 ]"

Proof of Existence is an online service that verifies the existence of computer files as of a specific time .
"Currently , there are at least four types of blockchain networks — public blockchains , private blockchains , consortium blockchains and hybrid blockchains ."
Public blockchains
"A public blockchain has absolutely no access restrictions . Anyone with an Internet connection can send transactions to it as well as become a validator ( i.e. , participate in the execution of a consensus protocol ) . [ 112 ] [ self-published source ? ] Usually , such networks offer economic incentives for those who secure them and utilize some type of a Proof of Stake or Proof of Work algorithm ."
"Some of the largest , most known public blockchains are the bitcoin blockchain and the Ethereum blockchain ."
Private blockchains
"A private blockchain is permissioned . [ 41 ] One can not join it unless invited by the network administrators . Participant and validator access is restricted . To distinguish between open blockchains and other peer-to-peer decentralized database applications that are not open ad-hoc compute clusters , the terminology Distributed Ledger ( DLT ) is normally used for private blockchains ."
Hybrid blockchains
A hybrid blockchain has a combination of centralized and decentralized features . [ 113 ] The exact workings of the chain can vary based on which portions of centralization decentralization are used .
Sidechains
"A sidechain is a designation for a blockchain ledger that runs in parallel to a primary blockchain . [ 114 ] [ 115 ] Entries from the primary blockchain ( where said entries typically represent digital assets ) can be linked to and from the sidechain ; this allows the sidechain to otherwise operate independently of the primary blockchain ( e.g. , by using an alternate means of record keeping , alternate consensus algorithm , etc . )"
"With the increasing number of blockchain systems appearing , even only those that support cryptocurrencies , blockchain interoperability is becoming a topic of major importance . The objective is to support transferring assets from one blockchain system to another blockchain system . Wegner [ 117 ] stated that `` interoperability is the ability of two or more software components to cooperate despite differences in language , interface , and execution platform '' . The objective of blockchain interoperability is therefore to support such cooperation among blockchain systems , despite those kinds of differences ."
"There are already several blockchain interoperability solutions available . [ 118 ] They can be classified in three categories : cryptocurrency interoperability approaches , blockchain engines , and blockchain connectors ."
The IETF has a recent Blockchain-interop working group that already produced the draft of a blockchain interoperability architecture .
"In October 2014 , the MIT Bitcoin Club , with funding from MIT alumni , provided undergraduate students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology access to $ 100 of bitcoin . The adoption rates , as studied by Catalini and Tucker ( 2016 ) , revealed that when people who typically adopt technologies early are given delayed access , they tend to reject the technology . [ 120 ]"
Adoption decision
"Motivations for adopting blockchain technology have been investigated by researchers . Janssen et al . provided a framework for analysis . [ 121 ] Koens & Poll pointed out that adoption could be heavily driven by non-technical factors . [ 122 ] Based on behavioral models , Li [ 123 ] discussed the differences between adoption at individual level and at organization level ."
Collaboration
"Scholars in business and management have started studying the role of blockchains to support collaboration . [ 124 ] [ 125 ] It has been argued that blockchains can foster both cooperation ( i.e. , prevention of opportunistic behavior ) and coordination ( i.e. , communication and information sharing ) . Thanks to reliability , transparency , traceability of records , and information immutability , blockchains facilitate collaboration in a way that differs both from the traditional use of contracts and from relational norms . [ 126 ] Contrary to contracts , blockchains do not directly rely on the legal system to enforce agreements . In addition , contrary to the use of relational norms , blockchains do not require trust or direct connections between collaborators ."
"The need for internal audit to provide effective oversight of organizational efficiency will require a change in the way that information is accessed in new formats . [ 128 ] Blockchain adoption requires a framework to identify the risk of exposure associated with transactions using blockchain . The Institute of Internal Auditors has identified the need for internal auditors to address this transformational technology . New methods are required to develop audit plans that identify threats and risks . The Internal Audit Foundation study , Blockchain and Internal Audit , assesses these factors . [ 129 ] The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants has outlined new roles for auditors as a result of blockchain . [ 130 ]"
"The Bank for International Settlements has criticized the public proof-of-work blockchains for high energy consumption . [ 131 ] [ 132 ] [ 133 ] Nicholas Weaver , of the International Computer Science Institute at the University of California , Berkeley examines blockchain 's online security , and the energy efficiency of proof-of-work public blockchains , and in both cases finds it grossly inadequate . [ 134 ] [ 135 ] The 31—45 TWh of electricity used for bitcoin in 2018 produced 17—22.9 MtCO2 ."
"In September 2015 , the first peer-reviewed academic journal dedicated to cryptocurrency and blockchain technology research , Ledger , was announced . The inaugural issue was published in December 2016 . [ 138 ] The journal covers aspects of mathematics , computer science , engineering , law , economics and philosophy that relate to cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin . [ 139 ] [ 140 ]"
"The journal encourages authors to digitally sign a file hash of submitted papers , which are then timestamped into the bitcoin blockchain . Authors are also asked to include a personal bitcoin address in the first page of their papers for non-repudiation purposes ."
"Multiversion concurrency control ( MCC or MVCC ) , is a concurrency control method commonly used by database management systems to provide concurrent access to the database and in programming languages to implement transactional memory ."
"MVCC is particularly adept at implementing true snapshot isolation , something which other methods of concurrency control frequently do either incompletely or with high performance costs ."
"A distributed ledger ( also called a shared ledger or distributed ledger technology or DLT ) is a consensus of replicated , shared , and synchronized digital data geographically spread across multiple sites , countries , or institutions . [ 1 ] Unlike with a distributed database , there is no central administrator . [ 2 ]"
"In some cases other denomination is used : RJT for Replicated Journal Technology , since the information is replicated in the nodes containing full copy of the information and the information in the blocks is included in timely order , more in the form of an accounting journal than as an accounting ledger . [ 3 ]"
"A peer-to-peer network is required as well as consensus algorithms to ensure replication across nodes is undertaken . [ 2 ] One form of distributed ledger design is the blockchain system , which can be either public or private ."
"Distributed ledgers may be permissioned or permissionless . This determines if anyone or only approved people can run a node to validate transactions . [ 10 ] They also vary between the consensus algorithm – proof of work , proof of stake , or voting systems . They may be mineable ( one can claim ownership of new coins contributing with a node ) or not ( the creator of the cryptocurrency owns all at the beginning ) ."
All blockchain is considered to be a form of DLT . There are also non-blockchain distributed ledger tables .
Non-blockchain DLTs can be in the form of a distributed cryptocurrency or they may be the architecture on which private or public data is stored or shared .
The main difference is that while blockchain requires global consensus across all nodes a DLT can achieve consensus without having to validate across the entire blockchain .
"In 1998 , Szabo proposed that smart contract infrastructure can be implemented by replicated asset registries and contract execution using cryptographic hash chains and Byzantine fault-tolerant replication . [ 39 ] Askemos implemented this approach in 2002 [ 40 ] [ 41 ] using Scheme ( later adding SQLite [ 42 ] [ 43 ] ) as contract script language . [ 44 ]"
"One proposal for using bitcoin for replicated asset registration and contract execution is called `` colored coins '' . [ 45 ] Replicated titles for potentially arbitrary forms of property , along with replicated contract execution , are implemented in different projects ."
"As of 2015 , UBS was experimenting with `` smart bonds '' that use the bitcoin blockchain [ 46 ] in which payment streams could hypothetically be fully automated , creating a self-paying instrument ."
"A smart contract is a computer program or a transaction protocol which is intended to automatically execute , control or document legally relevant events and actions according to the terms of a contract or an agreement . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] The objectives of smart contracts are the reduction of need in trusted intermediators , arbitrations and enforcement costs , fraud losses , as well as the reduction of malicious and accidental exceptions . [ 5 ] [ 2 ]"
"Vending machines are mentioned as the oldest piece of technology equivalent to smart contract implementation . [ 3 ] 2014 's white paper about the cryptocurrency Ethereum [ 6 ] describes the Bitcoin protocol as a weak version of the smart contract concept as defined by computer scientist , lawyer and cryptographer Nick Szabo . Since Ethereum , various cryptocurrencies support scripting languages which allow for more advanced smart contracts between untrusted parties . [ 7 ] Smart contracts should be distinguished from smart legal contracts . The latter refers to a traditional natural language legally-binding agreement which has certain terms expressed and implemented in machine-readable code ."
A CryptoKitty 's ownership is tracked via a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain . Each CryptoKitty is represented as a non-fungible token using the ERC-721 token standard on Ethereum . Generation 0 CryptoKitties were sold to players in an auction at the rate of one every 15 minutes ( 672 per week ) for one year . New CryptoKitties are created by breeding existing CryptoKitties .
"Another method of producing power to the grid is through virtual net metering ( also called peer-to-peer ( P2P ) energy trading , wheeling and sometimes local energy trading ) . [ 135 ] Peer-to-Peer energy trading is a novel paradigm of power system operation , where sellers can generate their own energy in dwellings , offices and factories , and share it with each other locally . [ 136 ] [ 137 ] [ 138 ] [ 139 ] Several companies offering virtual net metering use blockchain technology ."
"Hyperledger ( or the Hyperledger project ) is an umbrella project of open source blockchains and related tools , started in December 2015 by the Linux Foundation , [ 1 ] and has received contributions from IBM , Intel and SAP Ariba , to support the collaborative development of blockchain-based distributed ledgers ."
"A cryptocurrency wallet is a device , [ 1 ] physical medium , [ 2 ] program or a service which stores the public and/or private keys [ 3 ] for cryptocurrency transactions . In addition to this basic function of storing the keys , a cryptocurrency wallet more often also offers the functionality of encrypting and/or signing information . Signing can for example result in executing a smart contract , a cryptocurrency transaction ( see `` bitcoin transaction '' image ) , identification or legally signing a 'document ' ( see `` application form '' image ) ."
"A simple cryptocurrency wallet contains pairs of public and private cryptographic keys . The keys can be used to track ownership , receive or spend cryptocurrencies . [ 5 ] A public key allows others to make payments to the address derived from it , whereas a private key enables the spending of cryptocurrency from that address . [ 6 ]"
"The cryptocurrency itself is not in the wallet . In the case of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies derived from it , the cryptocurrency is decentrally stored and maintained in a publicly available distributed ledger called the blockchain ."
"Some wallets are specifically designed to be compatible with a framework . The European Union is creating an eIDAS compatible European Self-Sovereign Identity Framework ( ESSIF ) which runs on the European Blockchain Services Infrastructure ( EBSI ) . The EBSI wallet is designed to ( securely ) provide information , an eID and to sign 'transactions ' ."
eID wallet
"In contrast to simple cryptocurrency wallets requiring just one party to sign a transaction , multisignature wallets require multiple parties to sign a transaction . [ 7 ] Multisignature wallets are designed to have increased security ."
"In the cryptocurrency space , smart contracts are digitally signed in the same way a cryptocurrency transaction is signed . The signing keys are held in a cryptocurrency wallet ."
"Decentralized computing is the allocation of resources , both hardware and software , to each individual workstation , or office location . In contrast , centralized computing exists when the majority of functions are carried out , or obtained from a remote centralized location . Decentralized computing is a trend in modern-day business environments . This is the opposite of centralized computing , which was prevalent during the early days of computers . A decentralized computer system has many benefits over a conventional centralized network . [ 1 ] Desktop computers have advanced so rapidly , that their potential performance far exceeds the requirements of most business applications . This results in most desktop computers remaining idle ( in relation to their full potential ) . A decentralized system can use the potential of these systems to maximize efficiency . However , it is debatable whether these networks increase overall effectiveness ."
"All computers have to be updated individually with new software , unlike a centralized computer system . Decentralized systems still enable file sharing and all computers can share peripherals such as printers and scanners as well as modems , allowing all the computers in the network to connect to the internet ."
"A collection of decentralized computers systems are components of a larger computer network , held together by local stations of equal importance and capability . These systems are capable of running independently of each other ."
"One of the most interesting debates over decentralized computing involved Napster , a music file sharing application , which granted users access to an enormous database of files . Record companies brought legal action against Napster , blaming the system for lost record sales . Napster was found in violation of copyright laws by distributing unlicensed software , and was shut down . [ 2 ]"
"After the fall of Napster , there was demand for a file sharing system that would be less vulnerable to litigation . Gnutella , a decentralized system , was developed . This system allowed files to be queried and shared between users without relying upon a central directory , and this decentralization shielded the network from litigation related to the actions of individual users ."
Decentralized network 42 ( also known as dn42 ) is a decentralized peer-to-peer network built using VPNs and software/hardware BGP routers .
"Centralized computing is computing done at a central location , using terminals that are attached to a central computer . The computer itself may control all the peripherals directly ( if they are physically connected to the central computer ) , or they may be attached via a terminal server . Alternatively , if the terminals have the capability , they may be able to connect to the central computer over the network . The terminals may be text terminals or thin clients , for example ."
"Ethereum is a decentralized , open-source blockchain featuring smart contract functionality . Ether ( ETH ) is the native cryptocurrency of the platform . It is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization , after Bitcoin . [ 1 ] Ethereum is the most actively used blockchain ."
"Bitcoin is a singular form of digital money where users can send , receive , and hold only bitcoins . Ethereum is a smart contract platform which allows entities to leverage blockchain technology to create numerous different digital ledgers and can be used to create additional cryptocurrencies that run on top of its blockchain . For example , Ethereum can be used to create tokens that are pegged 1:1 with the value of the United States dollar ( called a stablecoin ) if a user wanted to transfer or hold the value of dollars on the blockchain . Ether itself can also be sent , received and held as digital money ."
"The EVM 's instruction set is Turing-complete , meaning that Ethereum contracts can do anything that computer programs in general can do . Popular uses of Ethereum have included the creation of fungible ( ERC20 ) and non-fungible ( ERC721 ) tokens with a variety of properties , crowdfunding ( eg . initial coin offerings ) , decentralized finance , decentralized exchanges , decentralized autonomous organizations ( DAOs ) , games , prediction markets , and verifiably-fair gambling ."
"Ethereum 's smart contracts are written in high-level programming languages and then compiled down to EVM bytecode and deployed to the Ethereum blockchain . They can be written in Solidity ( a language library with similarities to C and JavaScript ) , Serpent ( similar to Python , but deprecated ) , Yul ( an intermediate language that can compile to various different backends – EVM 1.0 , EVM 1.5 and eWASM are planned ) , LLL ( a low-level Lisp-like language ) , and Mutan ( Go-based , but deprecated ) . There is also a research-oriented language under development called Vyper ( a strongly-typed Python-derived decidable language ) . Source code and compiler information are usually published along with the launch of the contract so that users can see the code and verify that it compiles to the bytecode that is on-chain ."
"One issue related to using smart contracts on a public blockchain is that bugs , including security holes , are visible to all but can not be fixed quickly . [ 55 ] One example of this is the 2016 attack on The DAO , which could not be quickly stopped or reversed . [ 26 ]"
"There is ongoing research on how to use formal verification to express and prove non-trivial properties . A Microsoft Research report noted that writing solid smart contracts can be extremely difficult in practice , using The DAO hack to illustrate this problem . The report discussed tools that Microsoft had developed for verifying contracts , and noted that a large-scale analysis of published contracts is likely to uncover widespread vulnerabilities . The report also stated that it is possible to verify the equivalence of a Solidity program and the EVM code ."
The ERC-20 Token Standard allows for fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain . Numerous cryptocurrencies have launched as ERC-20 tokens and have been distributed through initial coin offerings . [ 57 ] Fees to send ERC-20 tokens must be paid with Ether .
"Decentralized finance ( DeFi ) is a use case of Ethereum . [ 58 ] It offers traditional financial instruments in a decentralized architecture , outside of companies ' and governments ' control , such as money market funds which let users earn interest . [ 59 ] Examples of DeFi platforms include MakerDAO and Compound . Uniswap , a decentralized exchange for tokens on Ethereum grew from $ 20 million in liquidity to $ 2.9 billion in 2020 . [ 60 ] As of October 2020 , over $ 11 billion was invested in various DeFi protocols . [ 61 ] Additionally , through a process called `` wrapping '' , certain DeFi protocols allow synthetic versions of various assets ( such as Bitcoin , gold and oil ) to become available and tradeable on Ethereum and also compatible with all of Ethereum 's major wallets and applications ."
"Ethereum-based software and networks , independent from the public Ethereum chain , are being tested by enterprise software companies . [ 62 ] Interested parties include Microsoft , IBM , JPMorgan Chase , [ 40 ] Deloitte , R3 , and Innovate UK ( cross-border payments prototype ) . [ 63 ] Barclays , UBS , Credit Suisse , Amazon , and other companies are also experimenting with Ethereum ."
"Ethereum 's blockchain uses Merkle trees , for security reasons , to improve scalability , and to optimize transaction hashing . [ 71 ] As with any Merkle tree implementation , it allows for storage savings , set membership proofs ( called `` Merkle proofs '' ) , and light client synchronization . The network has faced congestion problems , such as in 2017 in relation to Cryptokitties ."
"A cryptographic hash function ( CHF ) is a mathematical algorithm that maps data of arbitrary size ( often called the `` message '' ) to a bit array of a fixed size ( the `` hash value '' , `` hash '' , or `` message digest '' ) . It is a one-way function , that is , a function which is practically infeasible to invert . [ 1 ] Ideally , the only way to find a message that produces a given hash is to attempt a brute-force search of possible inputs to see if they produce a match , or use a rainbow table of matched hashes . Cryptographic hash functions are a basic tool of modern cryptography ."
"Cryptographic hash functions have many information-security applications , notably in digital signatures , message authentication codes ( MACs ) , and other forms of authentication . They can also be used as ordinary hash functions , to index data in hash tables , for fingerprinting , to detect duplicate data or uniquely identify files , and as checksums to detect accidental data corruption . Indeed , in information-security contexts , cryptographic hash values are sometimes called ( digital ) fingerprints , checksums , or just hash values , even though all these terms stand for more general functions with rather different properties and purposes ."
"An important application of secure hashes is the verification of message integrity . Comparing message digests ( hash digests over the message ) calculated before , and after , transmission can determine whether any changes have been made to the message or file ."
"MD5 , SHA-1 , or SHA-2 hash digests are sometimes published on websites or forums to allow verification of integrity for downloaded files , [ 8 ] including files retrieved using file sharing such as mirroring . This practice establishes a chain of trust as long as the hashes are posted on a trusted site - usually the originating site - authenticated by HTTPS . Using a cryptographic hash and a chain of trust detects malicious changes to the file . Other error detecting codes such as cyclic redundancy checks only prevent against non-malicious alterations of the file made by others ."
"Almost all digital signature schemes require a cryptographic hash to be calculated over the message . This allows the signature calculation to be performed on the relatively small , statically sized hash digest . The message is considered authentic if the signature verification succeeds given the signature and recalculated hash digest over the message . So the message integrity property of the cryptographic hash is used to create secure and efficient digital signature schemes ."
"Standard cryptographic hash functions are designed to be computed quickly , and , as a result , it is possible to try guessed passwords at high rates . Common graphics processing units can try billions of possible passwords each second . Password hash functions that perform key stretching – such as PBKDF2 , scrypt or Argon2 – commonly use repeated invocations of a cryptographic hash to increase the time ( and in some cases computer memory ) required to perform brute-force attacks on stored password hash digests . A password hash requires the use of a large random , non-secret salt value which can be stored with the password hash . The salt randomizes the output of the password hash , making it impossible for an adversary to store tables of passwords and precomputed hash values to which the password hash digest can be compared ."
The output of a password hash function can also be used as a cryptographic key . Password hashes are therefore also known as password-based key derivation functions ( PBKDFs ) .
"A proof-of-work system ( or protocol , or function ) is an economic measure to deter denial-of-service attacks and other service abuses such as spam on a network by requiring some work from the service requester , usually meaning processing time by a computer . A key feature of these schemes is their asymmetry : the work must be moderately hard ( but feasible ) on the requester side but easy to check for the service provider . One popular system – used in Bitcoin mining and Hashcash – uses partial hash inversions to prove that work was done , to unlock a mining reward in Bitcoin , and as a good-will token to send an e-mail in Hashcash . The sender is required to find a message whose hash value begins with a number of zero bits . The average work that the sender needs to perform in order to find a valid message is exponential in the number of zero bits required in the hash value , while the recipient can verify the validity of the message by executing a single hash function . For instance , in Hashcash , a sender is asked to generate a header whose 160-bit SHA-1 hash value has the first 20 bits as zeros . The sender will on average have to try 219 times to find a valid header ."
"A message digest can also serve as a means of reliably identifying a file ; several source code management systems , including Git , Mercurial and Monotone , use the sha1sum of various types of content ( file content , directory trees , ancestry information , etc . ) to uniquely identify them . Hashes are used to identify files on peer-to-peer filesharing networks . For example , in an ed2k link , an MD4-variant hash is combined with the file size , providing sufficient information for locating file sources , downloading the file , and verifying its contents . Magnet links are another example . Such file hashes are often the top hash of a hash list or a hash tree which allows for additional benefits ."
"There are several methods to use a block cipher to build a cryptographic hash function , specifically a one-way compression function ."
"The methods resemble the block cipher modes of operation usually used for encryption . Many well-known hash functions , including MD4 , MD5 , SHA-1 and SHA-2 are built from block-cipher-like components designed for the purpose , with feedback to ensure that the resulting function is not invertible . SHA-3 finalists included functions with block-cipher-like components ( e.g. , Skein , BLAKE ) though the function finally selected , Keccak , was built on a cryptographic sponge instead ."
"A standard block cipher such as AES can be used in place of these custom block ciphers ; that might be useful when an embedded system needs to implement both encryption and hashing with minimal code size or hardware area . However , that approach can have costs in efficiency and security . The ciphers in hash functions are built for hashing : they use large keys and blocks , can efficiently change keys every block , and have been designed and vetted for resistance to related-key attacks . General-purpose ciphers tend to have different design goals . In particular , AES has key and block sizes that make it nontrivial to use to generate long hash values ; AES encryption becomes less efficient when the key changes each block ; and related-key attacks make it potentially less secure for use in a hash function than for encryption ."
"Hash functions can be used to build other cryptographic primitives . For these other primitives to be cryptographically secure , care must be taken to build them correctly ."
Message authentication codes ( MACs ) ( also called keyed hash functions ) are often built from hash functions . HMAC is such a MAC .
"Just as block ciphers can be used to build hash functions , hash functions can be used to build block ciphers . Luby-Rackoff constructions using hash functions can be provably secure if the underlying hash function is secure . Also , many hash functions ( including SHA-1 and SHA-2 ) are built by using a special-purpose block cipher in a Davies–Meyer or other construction . That cipher can also be used in a conventional mode of operation , without the same security guarantees . See SHACAL , BEAR and LION ."
Pseudorandom number generators ( PRNGs ) can be built using hash functions . This is done by combining a ( secret ) random seed with a counter and hashing it .
"Some hash functions , such as Skein , Keccak , and RadioGatún output an arbitrarily long stream and can be used as a stream cipher , and stream ciphers can also be built from fixed-length digest hash functions . Often this is done by first building a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator and then using its stream of random bytes as keystream . SEAL is a stream cipher that uses SHA-1 to generate internal tables , which are then used in a keystream generator more or less unrelated to the hash algorithm . SEAL is not guaranteed to be as strong ( or weak ) as SHA-1 . Similarly , the key expansion of the HC-128 and HC-256 stream ciphers makes heavy use of the SHA-256 hash function ."
"Concatenating outputs from multiple hash functions provide collision resistance as good as the strongest of the algorithms included in the concatenated result . [ citation needed ] For example , older versions of Transport Layer Security ( TLS ) and Secure Sockets Layer ( SSL ) used concatenated MD5 and SHA-1 sums . [ 14 ] [ 15 ] This ensures that a method to find collisions in one of the hash functions does not defeat data protected by both hash functions . [ citation needed ]"
"For Merkle–Damgård construction hash functions , the concatenated function is as collision-resistant as its strongest component , but not more collision-resistant . [ citation needed ] Antoine Joux observed that 2-collisions lead to n-collisions : if it is feasible for an attacker to find two messages with the same MD5 hash , then they can find as many additional messages with that same MD5 hash as they desire , with no greater difficulty . [ 16 ] Among those n messages with the same MD5 hash , there is likely to be a collision in SHA-1 . The additional work needed to find the SHA-1 collision ( beyond the exponential birthday search ) requires only polynomial time ."
The Lightning Network is a `` layer 2 '' payment protocol that operates on top of a blockchain-based cryptocurrency ( like bitcoin ) . It is intended to enable fast transactions among participating nodes and has been proposed as a solution to the bitcoin scalability problem . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] It features a peer-to-peer system for making micropayments of cryptocurrency through a network of bidirectional payment channels without delegating custody of funds . [ 3 ] Lightning Network implementation also simplifies atomic swaps .
Proof of authority ( PoA ) is an algorithm used with blockchains that delivers comparatively fast transactions through a consensus mechanism based on identity as a stake . [ citation needed ] The most notable platform using PoA is VeChain .
"Proof of personhood ( PoP ) is a participation and Sybil attack resistance method for permissionless consensus , in which each unique human participant obtains one equal unit of voting power and associated rewards . In contrast with proof of work , proof of stake , and other approaches that confer voting power and rewards in a blockchain or cryptocurrency proportionately to a participant 's investment in some activity or resource , proof of personhood aims to guarantee each unique human participant an equal amount of voting power and rewards , independent of economic investment ."
"Proof of space ( PoSpace ) , also called Proof-of-capacity ( PoC ) or Proof-of-storage , is a means of showing that one has a legitimate interest in a service ( such as sending an email ) by allocating a non-trivial amount of memory or disk space to solve a challenge presented by the service provider ."
"Proofs of space are very similar to proofs of work , except that instead of computation , storage is used . Proof-of-space is related to , but also considerably different from , memory-hard functions and proofs of retrievability ."
"After the release of Bitcoin , alternatives to its PoW mining mechanism were researched and PoSpace was studied in the context of cryptocurrencies . Proofs of space are seen as a fairer and greener alternative by blockchain enthusiasts due to the general-purpose nature of storage and the lower energy cost required by storage . Several theoretical and practical implementations of PoSpace have been released and discussed , such as SpaceMint and Burstcoin ."
"PoS is also being used in cloud storage technologies in which the peers contribute their free disk space and get service proportionately . However , peers can also get paid if they let their free space to be used by peers that need more space . Storj is a PoS based cloud storage example ."
"Proof of stake ( PoS ) is a type of consensus mechanisms by which a cryptocurrency blockchain network achieves distributed consensus . In PoS-based cryptocurrencies the creator of the next block is chosen via various combinations of random selection and wealth or age ( i.e. , the stake ) ."
"A consensus mechanism can be structured in a number of ways . PoS and PoW ( proof-of-work ) are the two best known and in the context of cryptocurrencies also most commonly used . Incentives differ between the two systems of block generation . The algorithm of PoW-based cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin uses mining ; that is , the solving of computationally intensive puzzles to validate transactions and create new blocks . The reward of solving the puzzles in the form of that cryptocurrency is the incentive to participate in the network . The PoW mechanism requires a vast amount of computing resources , which consume a significant amount of electricity . With PoS there is no need for 'hard Work ' . Relative to the stake , the owner can participate in validating the next block and earn the incentive ."
"Decentralized finance ( commonly referred to as DeFi ) is an experimental form of finance that does not rely on central financial intermediaries such as brokerages , exchanges , or banks , and instead utilizes smart contracts on blockchains , the most common being Ethereum . [ 1 ] DeFi platforms allow people to lend or borrow funds from others , speculate on price movements on a range of assets using derivatives , trade cryptocurrencies , insure against risks , and earn interest in savings-like accounts . [ 2 ] Some DeFi applications promote high interest rates , [ 2 ] but are subject to high risk . [ 1 ] By October 2020 , over $ 11 billion was deposited in various decentralized finance protocols , which represented more than a tenfold growth during the course of 2020 . [ 3 ] [ 2 ] As of January 2021 , approximately $ 20.5 billion was invested in DeFi ."
"DeFi revolves around applications known as DApps ( decentralized applications ) that perform financial functions on digital ledgers called blockchains , a technology that was first utilized by Bitcoin but has since caught on more broadly . [ 2 ] Rather than transactions being made with and through a centralized intermediary such as a cryptocurrency exchange , transactions are directly between participants , mediated by smart contract programs . [ 1 ] DApps are typically accessed through a Web3 enabled browser extension or application , such as MetaMask which allows users to directly interact with the Ethereum blockchain through a website . [ 11 ] [ 12 ] Many of these DApps can connect and work together to create complex financial services . [ 2 ] For example , stablecoin holders can commit assets to a liquidity pool . Others can borrow from this pool , by contributing additional collateral , typically more than the amount of the loan . The protocol automatically adjusts interest rates based upon the moment-to-moment demand for the asset ."
"One example of a DeFi protocol is Uniswap , which is a decentralized exchange or dex that runs on the Ethereum blockchain and allows for the trading of hundreds of different digital tokens that are issued on the Ethereum blockchain . Rather than relying on centralized market makers to fill orders , Uniswap 's algorithm incentivizes users to form liquidity pools for the tokens by issuing trade fees to those providing liquidity . A development team writes software for deployment on Uniswap , but the platform is ultimately governed by its users . Because no centralized party runs Uniswap , there is no one to check the identities of the people using the platform . It is not clear what position regulators will take on the legality of a platform like Uniswap ."
"The DAO ( stylized Ð ) was a digital decentralized autonomous organization , [ 5 ] and a form of investor-directed venture capital fund . [ 6 ] It launched in April 2016 after a crowdfunding campaign . By September 2016 , it was delisted and had , in effect , become defunct ."
"The DAO had an objective to provide a new decentralized business model for organizing both commercial and non-profit enterprises . [ 7 ] [ 8 ] It was instantiated on the Ethereum blockchain , and had no conventional management structure or board of directors . [ 7 ] The code of the DAO is open-source ."
"Proof of work ( PoW ) is a form of cryptographic zero-knowledge proof in which one party ( the prover ) proves to others ( the verifiers ) that a certain amount of computational effort has been expended for some purpose . Verifiers can subsequently confirm this expenditure with minimal effort on their part . The concept was invented by Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor in 1993 as a way to deter denial-of-service attacks and other service abuses such as spam on a network by requiring some work from a service requester , usually meaning processing time by a computer . The term `` proof of work '' was first coined and formalized in a 1999 paper by Markus Jakobsson and Ari Juels . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] Proof of work was later popularized by Bitcoin as a foundation for consensus in permissionless blockchains and cryptocurrencies , in which miners compete to append blocks and mint new currency , each miner experiencing a success probability proportional to their computational effort provably expended . PoW and PoS ( Proof of Stake ) are the two best known consensus mechanisms . In the context of cryptocurrencies they are the most common mechanisms ."
"Computer scientist Hal Finney built on the proof-of-work idea , yielding a system that exploited reusable proof of work ( RPoW ) . [ 19 ] The idea of making proofs of work reusable for some practical purpose had already been established in 1999 . [ 1 ] Finney 's purpose for RPoW was as token money . Just as a gold coin 's value is thought to be underpinned by the value of the raw gold needed to make it , the value of an RPoW token is guaranteed by the value of the real-world resources required to 'mint ' a PoW token . In Finney 's version of RPoW , the PoW token is a piece of Hashcash ."
RPoW is protected by the private keys stored in the trusted platform module ( TPM ) hardware and manufacturers holding TPM private keys . Stealing a TPM manufacturer 's key or obtaining the key by examining the TPM chip itself would subvert that assurance .
"Distributed computing is a field of computer science that studies distributed systems . A distributed system is a system whose components are located on different networked computers , which communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages to one another from any system . [ 1 ] The components interact with one another in order to achieve a common goal . Three significant characteristics of distributed systems are : concurrency of components , lack of a global clock , and independent failure of components . [ 1 ] Examples of distributed systems vary from SOA-based systems to massively multiplayer online games to peer-to-peer applications ."
"A computer program that runs within a distributed system is called a distributed program ( and distributed programming is the process of writing such programs ) . [ 2 ] There are many different types of implementations for the message passing mechanism , including pure HTTP , RPC-like connectors and message queues . [ 3 ]"
"Distributed computing also refers to the use of distributed systems to solve computational problems . In distributed computing , a problem is divided into many tasks , each of which is solved by one or more computers , [ 4 ] which communicate with each other via message passing ."
"Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency , without a central bank or single administrator that can be sent from user to user on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network without the need for intermediaries . [ 7 ] Transactions are verified by network nodes through cryptography and recorded in a public distributed ledger called a blockchain . Bitcoins are created as a reward for a process known as mining . They can be exchanged for other currencies , products , and services . [ 15 ] Research produced by the University of Cambridge estimated that in 2017 , there were 2.9 to 5.8 million unique users using a cryptocurrency wallet , most of them using bitcoin ."
"A wallet stores the information necessary to transact bitcoins . While wallets are often described as a place to hold [ 117 ] or store bitcoins , due to the nature of the system , bitcoins are inseparable from the blockchain transaction ledger . A wallet is more correctly defined as something that `` stores the digital credentials for your bitcoin holdings '' and allows one to access ( and spend ) them. [ 6 ] : ch . 1 , glossary Bitcoin uses public-key cryptography , in which two cryptographic keys , one public and one private , are generated . [ 118 ] At its most basic , a wallet is a collection of these keys ."
"Digital currency ( digital money , electronic money or electronic currency ) is a balance or a record stored in a distributed database on the Internet , in an electronic computer database , within digital files or within a stored-value card . [ 1 ] Examples of digital currencies include cryptocurrencies , virtual currencies , central bank digital currencies and e-Cash ."
Bitcoin Cash is a cryptocurrency that is a fork of Bitcoin . [ 5 ] [ 6 ] Bitcoin Cash is a spin-off or altcoin that was created in 2017 . [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 5 ]
"In November 2018 , Bitcoin Cash split into two cryptocurrencies : Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV . [ 9 ]"
Bitcoin Cash is sometimes also referred to as Bcash
"To keep the block generation time equal to ten minutes on average , both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash use an algorithm adjusting the mining difficulty parameter . This algorithm is called the difficulty adjustment algorithm ( DAA ) . Originally , both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash used the same difficulty adjustment algorithm , adjusting the mining difficulty parameter every 2016 blocks . Since 1 August 2017 , Bitcoin Cash also used an addition to the DAA , called an Emergency Difficulty Adjustment ( EDA ) algorithm . EDA was used alongside the original DAA and it was designed to decrease the mining difficulty of Bitcoin Cash by 20 % , if the time difference between 6 successive blocks was greater than 12 hours ."
"Counterparty is a peer-to-peer financial platform and distributed , open source Internet protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain and network . [ 1 ] It was one of the most well-known `` Bitcoin 2.0 '' platforms in 2014 , along with Mastercoin , Ethereum , Colored Coins , Ripple and BitShares . [ 2 ] It is a `` metacoin '' -type protocol . It provides such features as tradable user-created currencies , additional financial instruments and a decentralized asset exchange . [ 3 ] In November of 2014 , Counterparty added support for the Ethereum Virtual Machine to the Counterparty protocol and allowing all Ethereum decentralized applications to be run on the Bitcoin blockchain within the Counterparty protocol . [ 4 ] [ 5 ]"
"Counterparty has a native currency , XCP , which was created during January 2014 by 'proof of burn ' , a unique alternative to a crowdsale or ICO , designed to maximize the project 's legitimacy by eliminating any possible source of unfairness in the launch . To create XCP in the network , 2140 BTC , worth between US $ 1.6 million and US $ 2 million at the time , were destroyed by sending them to a provably unspendable Bitcoin address . [ 6 ] XCP is used in the Counterparty protocol to create new assets , make bets and callback callable assets issued with Counterparty . Counterparty used proof of burn to issue XCP , instead of a more traditional fund-raising technique for altcoin launches , to keep the initial distribution of funds as fair and decentralized as possible , and to avoid potential legal issues . [ 6 ]"
"counterpartyd is the reference implementation of the Counterparty protocol , and Counterwallet [ 5 ] is a deterministic web-wallet frontend to counterpartyd , in which all cryptography is handled client-side . Both are open source and hosted on GitHub . [ 7 ]"
"In 2014 , Counterparty was part of the first significant plan , led by global e-commerce company Overstock.com , to issue and trade legal securities on a blockchain . [ 8 ] The initiative , originally named `` Medici '' , [ 5 ] eventually became Overstock 's tZERO"
"MazaCoin ( Maza , MZC ) is a cryptocurrency launched in 2014 ."
"Namecoin ( Symbol : ℕ or NMC ) is a cryptocurrency originally forked from bitcoin software . It is based on the code of bitcoin and uses the same proof-of-work algorithm . Like bitcoin , it is limited to 21 million coins . [ 2 ]"
"Namecoin can store data within its own blockchain transaction database . The original proposal for Namecoin called for Namecoin to insert data into bitcoin 's blockchain directly . Anticipating scaling difficulties with this approach , a shared proof-of-work ( POW ) system was proposed to secure new cryptocurrencies with different use cases ."
"Namecoin 's flagship use case is the censorship-resistant top level domain .bit , which is functionally similar to .com or .net domains but is independent of ICANN , the main governing body for domain names ."
"Peercoin , also known as PPCoin or PPC , is a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency utilizing both proof-of-stake and proof-of-work systems ."
"Peercoin is based on an August 2012 paper which listed the authors as Scott Nadal and Sunny King . King , who also created Primecoin , is a pseudonym . [ 2 ] The Peercoin source code is distributed under the MIT/X11 software license ."
"In the proof-of-stake system , new coins are generated based on the holdings of individuals . In other words , someone holding 1 % of the currency will generate 1 % of all proof-of-stake coin blocks . This has the effect of making a monopoly more costly , and separates the risk of a monopoly from proof-of-work mining shares ."
Titcoin ( Ticker Symbol : TIT ) is a type of digital currency called a cryptocurrency that uses pornography on a decentralized peer-to-peer network to manage the issuance of new currency units while simultaneously processing transactions . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] Titcoin is a derivative of the Bitcoin source code with key modifications to the software which greatly improve transaction speeds and network difficulty readjustments . [ 3 ] Titcoin is exclusively designed for and marketed towards the adult entertainment industry to allow owners of the currency to pay for adult products and services without the fear of incriminating payment histories appearing on their credit cards . [ 4 ]
"In 2015 , Titcoin received two nominations at the 2015 XBIZ Awards ceremony which honors companies that play an essential part in the growth and success of adult entertainment . [ 5 ] In 2016 , Titcoin was nominated for a second year in a row as Alternative Payment Services Company of the Year at the 2016 XBIZ Awards . [ 6 ]"
"As of mid-2017 , it has a very low total market capitalization of about US $ 100,000 . There is no notable trade volume registered ."
"Auroracoin ( code : AUR , symbol : ᚠ ) is a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency launched in February 2014 as an Icelandic alternative to bitcoin and the Icelandic króna . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] The unknown creator or creators use the pseudonym Baldur Friggjar Óðinsson ( or Odinsson ) . [ 2 ] They stated that they planned to distribute half of auroracoins that would ever be created to all 330,000 people listed in Iceland 's national ID database beginning on March 25 , 2014 , free of charge , coming out to 31.8 auroracoins per person . [ 3 ] [ 2 ]"
"Auroracoin was created as an alternative currency to address the government restrictions on Iceland 's króna , in place since 2008 , which severely restricts movement of the currency outside the country ."
"Bitconnect ( also spelled BitConnect and stylized bitconnect , ticker BCC ) was an open-source cryptocurrency that was connected with the high-yield investment program ( a type of Ponzi scheme ) bitconnect.co . [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] After the platform administrators closed the earning platform on January 16 , 2018 , and distributed users funds in BCC , confidence was lost and the value of the coin plummeted to below $ 1 from a previous high of nearly $ 500 ."
"Bitcoin Gold ( BTG ) is a cryptocurrency . It is a hard fork of Bitcoin , the open source cryptocurrency . It is an open source , decentralized digital currency without a central bank or intermediary that can be sent from user to user on the peer-to-peer Bitcoin Gold network ."
The stated purpose of the hard fork is to change the proof of work algorithm so that application specific integrated circuits ( ASIC ) can not be used to mine the Bitcoin Gold blockchain .
"Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency invented by software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer , who decided to create a payment system that is instant , fun , and free from traditional banking fees . Dogecoin features the face of the Shiba Inu dog from the popular `` Doge '' meme as its logo and namesake . [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] It was introduced on December 6 , 2013 , and quickly developed its own online community reaching a market capitalization of US $ 5,382,875,000 on January 28 , 2021 ."
"Litecoin ( LTC or L ) is a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency and open-source software project released under the MIT/X11 license . Litecoin was an early bitcoin spinoff or altcoin , starting in October 2011 . [ 2 ] In technical details , Litecoin is nearly identical to Bitcoin ."
"Due to Litecoin 's use of the scrypt algorithm , FPGA and ASIC devices made for mining Litecoin are more complicated to create and more expensive to produce than they are for Bitcoin , which uses SHA-256 ."

"Zcash is a cryptocurrency aimed at using cryptography to provide enhanced privacy for its users compared to other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin . Zcash is based on Bitcoin 's codebase . [ 4 ] It shares many similarities such as a fixed total supply of 21 million units . Transactions can be `` transparent '' and similar to bitcoin transactions in which case they are controlled by a t-addr , or can be a type of zero-knowledge proof called zk-SNARKs ; the transactions are then said to be `` shielded '' and are controlled by a z-addr . Zcash coins are either in a transparent pool or a shielded pool"
"Monero ( /m ? ' n ? ro ? / ; XMR ) is a privacy-focused cryptocurrency released in 2014 . It is an open-source protocol based on CryptoNote . It uses an obfuscated public ledger , meaning anyone can send or broadcast transactions , but no outside observer can tell the source , amount , or destination . [ 1 ] A proof of work mechanism is used to issue new coins and incentivize miners to secure the network and validate transactions ."
"Monero uses different privacy-enhancing technologies to achieve anonymity and fungibility . It has attracted users desiring privacy measures that are not provided in more popular cryptocurrencies . However , it has also gained publicity for illicit use in darknet markets ."
"Dash is an open source cryptocurrency . It is an altcoin that was forked from the Bitcoin protocol . It is also a decentralized autonomous organization ( DAO ) run by a subset of its users , which are called `` masternodes '' . The currency permits transactions that can be untraceable ."
"The petro , or petromoneda , [ 2 ] launched in February 2018 , is a cryptocurrency issued by the government of Venezuela . [ 3 ] [ 4 ] As of August 2018 it does not appear to be used as a currency . Announced in December 2017 , it is supposed to be backed by the country 's oil and mineral reserves , and is intended to supplement Venezuela 's plummeting bolívar fuerte ( 'strong bolívar ' ) currency , as a means of circumventing U.S. sanctions and accessing international financing . On 20 August 2018 , the bolívar soberano ( 'sovereign bolívar ' ) was introduced , with the government stating it would be linked to the petro coin value ."

"IOTA is an open-source distributed ledger and cryptocurrency designed for the Internet of things ( IoT ) . [ 1 ] It uses a directed acyclic graph to store transactions on its ledger , motivated by a potentially higher scalability over blockchain based distributed ledgers . [ 1 ] IOTA does not use miners to validate transactions , instead , users that issue a new transaction must approve two previous transactions and perform a small amount of proof of work . [ 2 ] Transactions can therefore be issued without fees , facilitating microtransactions ."
"The IOTA token is a unit of value in the IOTA network . [ 38 ] There is a fixed supply of 2,779,530,283,277,761 iota tokens in circulation on the IOTA network . IOTA tokens are stored in IOTA wallets protected by an 81-character seed , similar to a password . [ 39 ] To access and spend the tokens , IOTA provides a cryptocurrency wallet . [ 40 ] A hardware wallet can be used to keep credentials offline while facilitating transactions ."
"The Tangle is the moniker used to describe IOTAs directed acyclic graph ( DAG ) transaction settlement and data integrity layer . [ 1 ] It is structured as a string of individual transactions that are interlinked to each other and stored through a network of node participants . [ 35 ] The Tangle does not have miners validating transactions , rather , network participants are jointly responsible for transaction validation , and must confirm two transactions already submitted to the network for every one transaction they issue . [ 36 ] Transactions can therefore be issued to the network at no cost , facilitating micropayments . [ 36 ] To avoid spam , every transaction requires computational resources based on Proof of Work ( PoW ) algorithms , to find the answer to a simple cryptographic puzzle . [ 37 ]"
"IOTA supports both value and data transfers . [ 2 ] A second layer protocol provides encryption and authentication of messages , or data streams , transmitted and stored on the Tangle as zero-value transactions . [ 37 ] Each message holds a reference to the address of a follow-up message , connecting the messages in a data stream , and providing forward secrecy . [ 37 ] Authorised parties with the correct decryption key can therefore only follow a datastream from their point of entry . [ 37 ] When the owner of the data stream wants to revoke access , it can change the decryption key when publishing a new message . [ 37 ] This provides the owner granular controls over the way in which data is exchanged to authorised parties ."
"IOTA requires a majority of honest actors to prevent network attacks . [ 1 ] However , as the concept of mining does not exist on the IOTA network , it is unlikely that this requirement will always be met . Therefore , consensus is currently obtained through referencing of transactions issued by a special node operated by the IOTA foundation , called the coordinator . [ 4 ] The coordinator issues zero value transactions at given time intervals , called milestones . [ 4 ] Any transaction , directly or indirectly , referenced by such a milestone is considered valid by the nodes in the network . The coordinator is an authority operated by the IOTA foundation and as such single point of failure for the IOTA network , which makes the network centralized ."
"Proof-of-concepts building on IOTA technology are being developed in the automotive and IoT industry by corporates as Jaguar Land Rover , STMicroelectronics and Bosch . [ 45 ] [ 46 ] [ 47 ] IOTA is a participant in smart city testbeds , to establish digital identity , waste management and local trade of energy . [ 48 ] [ 49 ] In project Alvarium , formed under the Linux Foundation , IOTA is used as an immutable storage and validation mechanism . [ 50 ] [ 51 ] The privacy centered search engine Xain uses IOTA as a trust anchor for its aggregated AI model . [ 52 ] [ 53 ]"
"On 11 February 2020 , the Eclipse Foundation and IOTA Foundation jointly launched the Tangle EE ( Enterprise Edition ) Working Group . [ 2 ] Tangle EE is aimed at enterprise users that can take IOTA technology and enable larger organizations to build applications on top of the project , where the Eclipse Foundation will provide a vendor-neutral governance framework . [ 54 ]"
"Announcements of partners were critically received . [ 55 ] [ 56 ] In 2017 , IOTA released the data marketplace , a pilot for a market where connected sensors or devices can store , sell or purchase data . [ 57 ] [ 58 ] The data marketplace was received critically by the cryptocurrency community over the extent of the involvement of the participants of the data marketplace , suggesting that `` the IOTA Foundation was actively asking publications to use Microsoft ’ s name following the data marketplace announcement. '' . [ 55 ] Izabelle Kaminska criticized a Jaguar press release : `` our interpretation is that it 's very unlikely Jaguar will be bringing a smart-wallet-enabled marketplace any time soon . ''"
"For potential efficiency reasons , IOTA 's data structures uses a balanced ternary implementation ; instead of bits , it uses trits ( -1 , 0 , 1 ) . [ 67 ] Its signature scheme is resistant against quantum computer attacks , due to its use of the Winternitz One Time Signature ( WOTS ) scheme . [ 68 ] Unlike traditional Winternitz , IOTA users sign the hash of a message . [ 67 ] With all existing hash designs being binary , a ternary prototype called Curl-P had been developed , instead of the well-studied alternatives that underpin other digital coins . [ 69 ] However , efficient cryptanalytic attacks on Curl-P have been devised , implying that it can not be considered a strong cryptographic hash function . [ 67 ] [ 70 ] Furthermore , due to IOTA ’ s choice of a one-time signature scheme , spending from an address multiple times drastically reduces the security of the funds at that address , because it exposes portions of the private key associated with the address . [ 68 ] [ 71 ]"
"After vulnerabilities were detected in Curl-P , the hashing algorithm was changed to Kerl , which is considered safe . [ 69 ] A drop-in replacement , called Troika , was later developed but never implemented . [ 72 ] [ 70 ] With Chrysalis and Coordicide , IOTA foundation plans to move to a binary implementation and change the signature scheme to Ed25519 in order to create a more enterprise-ready blockchain solution , although the timing is unclear ."
"Primecoin is a cryptocurrency that implements a proof-of-work system that searches for chains of prime numbers . Earlier cryptocurrencies , such as Bitcoin , were mined using algorithms that solved arbitrary mathematical problems , the results of which had no value or use outside of mining the cryptocurrency itself . Primecoin 's algorithm , however , computed chains of prime numbers ( Cunningham and bi-twin chains ) , the results of which were published on its blockchain 's public ledger , available for use by scientists , mathematicians , and anyone else . Use of a proof-of-work system to calculate chains of prime numbers was an innovation that produced useful results while also meeting the criteria for a proof-of-work system : it involved a calculation that was difficult to perform but easy to verify , and the difficulty was adjustable ."
"Verge Currency is a decentralized open-source cryptocurrency which offers various levels of private transactions .

"Cardano is a cryptocurrency network and open source project that aims to run a public blockchain platform for smart contracts . [ 5 ] Cardano 's internal cryptocurrency is called Ada . [ 6 ] The development of the project is overseen and supervised by the Cardano Foundation based in Zug , Switzerland ."
"Cardano uses Ouroboros proof of stake technology . In contrast , Bitcoin uses the proof of work system ; the first blockchain entry and the longest blockchain ( blockchain with the most computing power ) is used to determine the honest blockchain . Cardano uses only the first blockchain entry , whereafter the honest chain is proven locally without the need of a trusted party . Within the Cardano platform , Ada exists on the settlement layer . This layer is similar to Bitcoin and keeps track of transactions . The second layer is the computation layer . This layer is similar to Ethereum , enabling smart contracts and applications to run on the platform ."
"EOS.IO is a blockchain protocol based on the cryptocurrency EOS . The smart contract platform claims to eliminate transaction fees and also conduct millions of transactions per second . Based on a white paper published in 2017 , the EOSIO platform was developed by the private company block.one and released as open-source software on June 1 , 2018 . In order to ensure widespread distribution of the native cryptocurrency at the launch of the blockchain , one billion tokens were distributed as ERC-20 tokens by block.one . This provided the distribution to allow anyone to launch the EOS blockchain once the software was released . The CEO of block.one , Brendan Blumer , announced that block.one would support the EOSIO blockchain with over one billion USD in funding from the token sale and ultimately block.one raised over four billion USD to support the blockchain during the Initial Coin Offering ( ICO ) period ."
"block.one is a company registered in the Cayman Islands , which began offering EOS tokens in June 2017 to the public , raising over $ 4 billion ( a record for an ICO ) .
